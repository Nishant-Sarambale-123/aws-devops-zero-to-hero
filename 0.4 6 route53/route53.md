# 📘 **AWS Route 53 – Detailed Notes**

---

## 🔹 What is Route 53?

**Route 53** is a **scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service** from AWS. It is named after port **53**, which is used for DNS services.

### ✅ Key Functions of Route 53:

1. **Domain Registration** – Buy and manage domain names.
2. **DNS Routing** – Convert domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses.
3. **Health Checks** – Monitor health of resources (e.g., EC2, ELB) and route traffic accordingly.
4. **Traffic Flow Management** – Route traffic globally based on geography, latency, and more.

---

## 🔹 Core Components of Route 53

### 1. **Hosted Zones**

* A container for records that define how you want to route traffic for a domain.
* Two types:

  * **Public Hosted Zone**: For public websites (accessible over the internet).
  * **Private Hosted Zone**: For routing within an Amazon VPC (not accessible over the internet).

> 📌 Example: If you register `mywebsite.com`, a public hosted zone for it contains all the DNS records.

---

### 2. **Record Sets (DNS Records)**

Each record set defines how you want to route traffic for a domain or subdomain.

#### Common Record Types:

| Type  | Description                                                    |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A     | Maps domain to IPv4 address                                    |
| AAAA  | Maps domain to IPv6 address                                    |
| CNAME | Maps domain to another domain (alias)                          |
| MX    | For mail servers                                               |
| NS    | Name servers for a domain                                      |
| PTR   | Reverse DNS                                                    |
| SOA   | Info about the domain, serial, refresh rate, etc.              |
| TXT   | Human-readable info, SPF/DKIM data                             |
| SRV   | Service location                                               |
| Alias | AWS-specific record (maps to AWS resources like ELB, S3, etc.) |

> ⚠️ CNAME can’t be used at the root domain (e.g., `example.com`) — use **Alias** instead.

## 🔹 DNS Routing Policies in Route 53

### 1. **Simple Routing**

* Routes to a single resource.
* No health check support.

### 2. **Weighted Routing**

* Distributes traffic based on defined weights (0–255).
* Helps with gradual deployments, load balancing.

> 💡 Example: 80% to old version, 20% to new version.

### 3. **Latency-Based Routing**

* Sends users to the region with the lowest latency.
* Requires resources in multiple AWS regions.

### 4. **Failover Routing**

* Active-passive setup using health checks.
* Primary and secondary records defined.

### 5. **Geolocation Routing**

* Routes traffic based on the user’s **country or continent**.

### 6. **Geoproximity Routing** (with Traffic Flow)

* Routes based on **user location and resource proximity**.
* Allows **bias** setting to shift traffic.

### 7. **Multivalue Answer Routing**

* Returns multiple healthy IPs for DNS queries (like Round Robin).
* Includes **basic health checks**.

## 🔹 Alias vs CNAME

| Feature                 | Alias Record               | CNAME                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Root Domain?            | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                       |
| AWS Integration         | ✅ Yes (S3, ELB, CF, etc.)  | ❌ No                       |
| DNS Query Count Charges | ❌ No charge                | ✅ Yes                      |
| Redirects               | No (resolves at DNS level) | No (resolves at DNS level) |

---

## 🔹 Health Checks

* Monitors endpoint health (e.g., HTTP/S, TCP).
* Health check results impact **routing**.
* Can monitor:

  * **Web servers**
  * **Other health checks (calculated check)**

> 🔄 Used with **Failover, Weighted, and Multivalue Routing**.

---

## 🔹 Domain Registration

* Route 53 can **register domain names** (e.g., `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`).
* Provides:

  * WHOIS privacy
  * Auto-renewal
  * Domain locking

---

## 🔹 Routing Traffic to AWS Resources

You can route traffic to:

* **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
* **Amazon S3 static website**
* **Amazon CloudFront**
* **EC2 instance**
* **Any IP address**

Use **Alias records** for AWS integrations (recommended).

---

## 🔹 Route 53 Traffic Flow (Advanced Feature)

* Visual editor to create complex routing rules.
* Supports:

  * Latency routing
  * Geoproximity routing
  * Health checks
  * Failover scenarios

> 💡 Useful for global applications.

---

## 🔹 Route 53 Resolver (formerly Amazon DNS)

Handles:

* **Inbound DNS queries**: On-prem → VPC
* **Outbound DNS queries**: VPC → On-prem DNS

Common for **hybrid DNS resolution** between AWS and on-premises.

---

## 🔹 Security Features

4. **Domain Registration**: Annual fee depending on TLD.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases of Route 53

* Hosting public websites.
* Internal DNS for applications in VPC.
* Global application traffic management.
* Disaster recovery using failover routing.
* Geo-targeted marketing websites.

# 📌 Interview Questions on Route 53

### 1. What is Route 53 and why is it called that?

**Ans**: AWS Route 53 is a scalable DNS and domain registration service. The name comes from port 53 used for DNS queries.

---

### 2. What are the routing policies in Route 53?

**Ans**:

* Simple
* Weighted
* Latency-based
* Failover
* Geolocation
* Geoproximity
* Multivalue Answer

---

### 3. Difference between Alias and CNAME?

**Ans**:

* Alias works at root domain, CNAME doesn’t.
* Alias supports AWS resources.
* Alias doesn’t incur DNS charges.

---

### 4. What is a health check in Route 53?

**Ans**: A health check monitors the availability of resources like EC2 or websites. It's used to route traffic only to healthy resources.

---

### 5. Can we use Route 53 to route internal DNS?

**Ans**: Yes, by creating a **Private Hosted Zone** associated with a VPC.

---

### 6. What is Route 53 Resolver?

**Ans**: It's a DNS server that allows DNS resolution between on-premises and AWS networks in hybrid architectures.

---

### 7. How does failover routing work?

**Ans**: You define a primary and secondary resource. If the primary fails (detected via health check), traffic is routed to the secondary.

---

### 8. When would you use Geolocation vs Latency Routing?

* **Geolocation**: You want traffic to be based on user’s physical location.
* **Latency**: You want to direct users to the lowest latency region.

---

### 9. What is Multivalue Answer Routing?

**Ans**: Like round-robin DNS, it returns multiple IPs and performs health checks to route traffic only to healthy endpoints.

---

### 10. Can you register a domain via Route 53?

**Ans**: Yes, Route 53 allows domain registration and management.
