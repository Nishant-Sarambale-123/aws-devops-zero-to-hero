# üìò Migration Strategies ‚Äì Detailed Notes

When moving applications, data, or workloads from **on-premises ‚Üí cloud** (or between clouds), organizations follow well-known **migration strategies**. AWS defines them as the **‚Äú7 Rs of Migration‚Äù**.

---

## 1. Rehost (‚ÄúLift and Shift‚Äù)

* **Definition**: Moving applications to the cloud with little/no changes.
* **Approach**: Take an existing workload and deploy it as-is on cloud infrastructure (e.g., on AWS EC2).
* **Pros**:

  * Fastest method
  * Low upfront cost
  * Minimal training needed
* **Cons**:

  * Does not take advantage of cloud-native features
  * May result in higher operational cost long-term

**Example**: Migrating a virtual machine running a web app from VMware to AWS EC2 without changing the code.

---

## 2. Replatform (‚ÄúLift, Tinker, and Shift‚Äù)

* **Definition**: Making small optimizations during migration but not rewriting the application.
* **Approach**: Minor changes like moving from Oracle DB on-prem ‚Üí Amazon RDS, or updating middleware.
* **Pros**:

  * Takes some advantage of cloud features
  * Less effort than refactoring
* **Cons**:

  * Still limited modernization
  * May need future rework

**Example**: Migrating an app to EC2 but replacing the database with RDS.

---

## 3. Repurchase (‚ÄúDrop and Shop‚Äù)

* **Definition**: Moving to a different product (usually SaaS).
* **Approach**: Instead of migrating existing software, adopt a SaaS solution.
* **Pros**:

  * Immediate modernization
  * Lower operational overhead
* **Cons**:

  * Data migration challenges
  * Licensing/vendor lock-in issues

**Example**: Replacing on-prem CRM with Salesforce SaaS.

---

## 4. Refactor / Re-architect

* **Definition**: Rewriting or redesigning an application to be cloud-native.
* **Approach**: Break monolith ‚Üí microservices, use serverless (AWS Lambda), containers (EKS/ECS), cloud-native databases.
* **Pros**:

  * Maximum cloud benefits
  * Better scalability, resilience, agility
* **Cons**:

  * Expensive, time-consuming
  * Requires deep skills and planning

**Example**: Rewriting a monolithic Java application into microservices deployed on Kubernetes.

---

## 5. Retire

* **Definition**: Decommissioning applications no longer needed.
* **Approach**: Identify unused/duplicate apps and eliminate them.
* **Pros**:

  * Saves cost and effort
* **Cons**:

  * Requires careful business validation

**Example**: Removing an old HR system that is no longer used after adopting a new SaaS HR tool.

---

## 6. Retain (Revisit)

* **Definition**: Keeping applications in the current environment.
* **Approach**: Leave workloads on-prem/cloud if migration is not justified.
* **Pros**:

  * Avoids unnecessary migration effort
* **Cons**:

  * May delay modernization
* **Use Case**: Compliance/regulatory constraints, legacy apps not worth migrating yet.

**Example**: Keeping a mainframe workload on-prem until replacement is ready.

---

## 7. Relocate (VMware Cloud on AWS / Cloud Relocation)

* **Definition**: Move entire servers or clusters into the cloud without refactoring or even rehosting.
* **Approach**: Use tools like VMware Cloud on AWS or Azure VMware Solution.
* **Pros**:

  * Fast for large-scale migrations
  * Minimal changes required
* **Cons**:

  * Expensive compared to cloud-native
* **Example**: Moving hundreds of VMware VMs to VMware Cloud on AWS.

# ‚úÖ Migration Strategy Selection Criteria

Organizations usually select migration strategies based on:

1. **Business Drivers** ‚Äì Cost savings, agility, innovation.
2. **Application Complexity** ‚Äì Monolith vs. microservices.
3. **Technology Stack** ‚Äì Compatibility with cloud.
4. **Time Constraints** ‚Äì Urgency of migration.
5. **Compliance & Security** ‚Äì Legal/regulatory requirements.

---

# ‚ö° Migration Phases (High-Level Process)

1. **Assess** ‚Üí Analyze current workloads, dependencies, business case.
2. **Mobilize** ‚Üí Build landing zone, train teams, set up governance.
3. **Migrate & Modernize** ‚Üí Apply 7Rs, execute migration in waves.
4. **Operate & Optimize** ‚Üí Monitor, cost-optimize, and modernize further.

# üéØ Interview Q\&A on Migration Strategies

### Q1. What are the ‚Äú7 Rs‚Äù of migration?

**Answer**: Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Retire, Retain, Relocate.

---

### Q2. Difference between Rehost and Replatform?

**Answer**:

* **Rehost**: Move as-is without modifications.
* **Replatform**: Make small optimizations (like moving DB to RDS).

---

### Q3. When would you choose Refactoring?

**Answer**:

* When you need scalability, agility, cloud-native features, and long-term modernization.
* Example: Breaking a monolith into microservices for serverless deployment.

---

### Q4. What is Retire in migration?

**Answer**: Identifying and shutting down apps that are no longer needed, reducing cost and complexity.

---

### Q5. How is Repurchase different from Rehost?

**Answer**:

* Repurchase ‚Üí Adopt new SaaS (e.g., Salesforce, Workday).
* Rehost ‚Üí Move existing app as-is to cloud (EC2/VM).

---

### Q6. Which migration strategy is fastest?

**Answer**: **Rehost (Lift and Shift)** because it involves minimal changes.

---

### Q7. Which migration strategy is most costly and time-consuming?

**Answer**: **Refactor/Re-architect**, since it requires rewriting applications.

---

### Q8. Give an example of when to Retain workloads.

**Answer**: If an app is tightly coupled to on-prem hardware (like mainframe) or has compliance restrictions, you retain it until modernization is feasible.

---

### Q9. What is Relocate strategy?

**Answer**: Moving entire workloads (like VMware clusters) to cloud infrastructure without changing them, using services like VMware Cloud on AWS.

---

### Q10. How do you decide which migration strategy to apply?

**Answer**: By analyzing:

* Business objectives
* Application complexity
* Compliance requirements
* Cost-benefit analysis
* Time constraints

üëâ Do you want me to also prepare a **scenario-based Q\&A** (like ‚ÄúYour company has 200 on-prem apps, some old, some new ‚Äî how would you migrate?‚Äù) which often comes up in interviews?
Great question üëç

In **real-world production migrations**, organizations rarely stick to just one strategy. Instead, they **mix multiple strategies** depending on the workload. But based on industry experience (AWS, Azure, GCP migrations), the **most commonly used in production are**:

---

## üî• Most Commonly Used Migration Strategies

### 1. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**

* **Why common**:

  * Fastest way to move large numbers of applications to cloud.
  * Often used as the **first step** in migration.
* **Production reality**:

  * Companies migrate VMs as-is to EC2, then later optimize.
  * Reduces data center footprint quickly.
* **Example**: Moving 100+ enterprise VMs to AWS EC2 in a few months.

---

### 2. **Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**

* **Why common**:

  * Provides balance between speed and optimization.
  * Many enterprises use this for **databases** ‚Üí e.g., Oracle ‚Üí Amazon RDS, SQL Server ‚Üí Aurora.
* **Production reality**:

  * Teams don‚Äôt want complete rewrite, but want managed services to reduce ops burden.
* **Example**: Migrating apps to EC2 but replacing DB with RDS/Aurora.

---

### 3. **Repurchase (SaaS adoption)**

* **Why common**:

  * Widely used for standard enterprise workloads like CRM, ERP, HR, Email.
  * Instead of hosting themselves, companies move to SaaS (e.g., Salesforce, Office 365, Workday).
* **Example**: Migrating from on-prem Exchange to Office 365.

---

## Less Common in Initial Production Migration (but used later):

* **Refactor** ‚Üí used selectively for business-critical apps where agility/scalability is a must. But **time & cost** make it less common as an initial step.
* **Retire** ‚Üí usually done alongside rehost/replatform (eliminating unused apps).
* **Retain** ‚Üí common for legacy workloads that can‚Äôt yet move.
* **Relocate** ‚Üí used when enterprises have heavy VMware investment (niche compared to rehost/replatform).

---

## üìä Industry Trend (based on AWS/Microsoft/Gartner reports):

* **60‚Äì70%** of production migrations start with **Rehost** (Lift and Shift).
* **20‚Äì30%** use **Replatform** for key apps (DBs, middleware).
* **10‚Äì15%** adopt **Repurchase** (SaaS migration).
* **Refactor** happens later, usually during **modernization phase**, not initial migration.

---

‚úÖ **Final Answer (short):**
In production, the most common strategy is **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**, often combined with **Replatform** for databases and **Repurchase** for standard enterprise tools. Refactoring is less common at the start but done later for modernization.
