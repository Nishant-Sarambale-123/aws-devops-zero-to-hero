# üìò **AWS Lambda ‚Äì Complete Detailed Notes**

---

## ‚úÖ **What is AWS Lambda?**

**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code **without provisioning or managing servers**. You simply upload your code, and Lambda handles everything required to run and scale it.

* **Event-driven**
* **Automatically scalable**
* **Pay-as-you-go**

---

## üîπ **Key Benefits**

| Feature                         | Description                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Serverless**                  | No need to manage servers or infrastructure                |
| **Automatic Scaling**           | Scales in response to number of events                     |
| **High Availability**           | Built-in fault tolerance and redundancy                    |
| **Pay-per-use**                 | Charged based on execution time and memory                 |
| **Supports Multiple Languages** | Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET, and custom runtimes |

---

## üß† **How AWS Lambda Works**

1. **Event Source** (e.g., S3, API Gateway, CloudWatch)
2. **Triggers** the Lambda Function
3. **Lambda Executes the Code**
4. Returns response or triggers another service (e.g., S3, DynamoDB)

---

## üî∏ **Core Components**

### 1. **Function**

* The actual code to execute

### 2. **Runtime**

* Language-specific environment to run code (e.g., Python 3.11, Node.js 20)

### 3. **Handler**

* Entry point for function execution

  * Example (Python): `lambda_function.lambda_handler`

### 4. **Event**

* JSON-formatted input that triggers the function

### 5. **Context Object**

* Provides metadata (memory, timeout, request ID)

---

---

## üî∏ **Deployment Options**

* **Console**
* **AWS CLI**
* **CloudFormation / SAM / CDK**
* **CI/CD Tools** (e.g., CodePipeline, GitHub Actions)

---

## üî∏ **Environment Variables**

* Used to pass configuration values (e.g., DB URL, secrets).
* Can be encrypted using **AWS KMS**.

---

## üî∏ **Lambda Layers**

* Shared libraries or dependencies across functions.
* Max of **5 layers** per function.
* Reduces function size.

---

## üî∏ **Resource Limits (Quotas)**

| Resource              | Limit                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Memory                | 128 MB ‚Äì 10,240 MB                          |
| Timeout               | Max 15 minutes                              |
| Package Size (Zipped) | 50 MB (via console), 250 MB (via S3)        |
| Temp Storage (/tmp)   | 512 MB (up to 10 GB with Ephemeral Storage) |
| Concurrent executions | Default: 1,000 (can be increased)           |

---

## üîπ **Security**

* Lambda runs inside a **VPC managed by AWS**, but can be configured to connect to your custom VPC.
* IAM Roles:

  * **Execution Role**: Grants permissions to access other AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).
  * **Resource-based policies**: Control who can invoke the function.

---

## üî∏ **Logging and Monitoring**

* Integrated with:

  * **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** (default logging)
  * **CloudWatch Metrics** (invocations, duration, errors, throttles)
  * **AWS X-Ray** (tracing, debugging, performance analysis)

---

## üî∏ **Pricing**

You are charged based on:

1. **Number of requests**

   * First 1M/month: Free
   * \$0.20 per 1M requests thereafter

2. **Duration (execution time √ó memory allocated)**

   * Free: 400,000 GB-seconds/month
   * Then charged based on GB-second

3. **Optional Costs**:

   * Provisioned Concurrency
   * Ephemeral storage
   * VPC networking

---

## üî∏ **Provisioned Concurrency vs Reserved Concurrency**

| Type            | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Provisioned** | Pre-warms Lambda for low-latency        |
| **Reserved**    | Sets max concurrency limit for function |

---

## üß† **Best Practices**

* Use environment variables for configuration.
* Externalize heavy dependencies using **Lambda Layers**.
* Use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for debugging.
* Set appropriate **timeouts** to avoid hanging.
* Use **Provisioned Concurrency** for low latency APIs.
* Secure with **least privilege IAM roles**.
* Clean up unused functions to save cost.

---

## üîÅ **Use Cases**

* Image/video processing on S3 upload
* REST APIs (via API Gateway + Lambda)
* Real-time data processing (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams)
* Scheduled tasks (cron)
* Chatbots, ML inference
* Automation (EBS snapshot cleanup, notifications)
