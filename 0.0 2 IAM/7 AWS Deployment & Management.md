# 🛠️ AWS Deployment & Management – Detailed Notes

---

## 📁 1. **AWS CloudFormation**

### 📌 **What is CloudFormation?**

AWS **CloudFormation** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** service that lets you **provision AWS infrastructure using code**. You write a **template** in **JSON** or **YAML** that describes the resources (like EC2, S3, VPC, etc.) you want to create.

---

### 🧱 **Key Concepts**

| Term           | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Template**   | A JSON/YAML file that defines the resources and configuration     |
| **Stack**      | A set of AWS resources created and managed as a single unit       |
| **Change Set** | A preview of how a proposed template update will change resources |
| **StackSet**   | Allows deploying stacks across multiple AWS accounts/regions      |

---

### ⚙️ **How it Works**

1. Write a template defining resources (EC2, S3, VPC, etc.)
2. Upload to CloudFormation.
3. CloudFormation provisions and manages the resources automatically.

---

### 🧰 **Features**

* Supports **almost all AWS services**.
* Allows **version-controlled infrastructure**.
* Works well with **CI/CD tools**.
* Supports **parameterization** and **mapping**.
* Detects **drift** (differences between template and live resources).
* Can use **nested stacks** to modularize templates.

---

### 📑 **Sample YAML Template**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-sample-bucket
```

---

### ✅ **Use Cases**

* Automating infrastructure setup.
* Creating repeatable, consistent environments.
* CI/CD deployment pipelines.
* Multi-region resource deployments.

---

### 🔐 **Best Practices**

* Always use **version control** (e.g., Git) for templates.
* Use **parameters** and **mappings** to make templates reusable.
* Use **change sets** before updating a stack.
* Modularize with **nested stacks** for better readability.

---

## 🚀 2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

### 📌 **What is Elastic Beanstalk?**
