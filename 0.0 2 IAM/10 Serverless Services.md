Here are **detailed notes** on AWS **Serverless Services**: **Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions**.

---

## üß† 1. **AWS Lambda ‚Äì Event-Driven Compute Service**

### üî∏ Overview:

* AWS Lambda lets you **run code without provisioning or managing servers**.
* Code is executed in **response to events** such as HTTP requests, file uploads, database updates, etc.

### üî∏ Key Features:

* **Languages supported**: Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET (C#), etc.
* **Trigger-based execution**: Lambda functions can be triggered by:

  * S3 (e.g., file uploads)
  * API Gateway (HTTP requests)
  * DynamoDB Streams (data changes)
  * CloudWatch Events (scheduling)
  * EventBridge, SNS, SQS, etc.
* **Execution duration**: Up to 15 minutes per invocation.
* **Memory allocation**: 128 MB ‚Äì 10,240 MB.
* **Scaling**: Automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests.
* **Timeout and retries**: Can be configured per function.
* **Security**: IAM role permissions; integrates with VPC for private resources.
* **Monitoring**: Integrated with CloudWatch Logs and metrics.
* **Pricing**: Pay only for the time your code runs ‚Äî based on:

  * Number of requests
  * Duration of execution (GB-seconds)

## üåê 2. **Amazon API Gateway ‚Äì Build and Manage APIs**

### üî∏ Overview:

* Fully managed service for **creating, publishing, securing, monitoring, and throttling APIs**.
* Supports:

  * **REST APIs** (traditional RESTful services)
  * **HTTP APIs** (simplified for Lambda integrations)
  * **WebSocket APIs** (real-time, bidirectional communication)

### üî∏ Key Features:

* **Integration with Lambda**: You can route HTTP requests directly to Lambda functions.
* **Security**:

  * IAM-based access
  * Lambda authorizers (custom logic)
  * Cognito user pools (user management)
  * API keys, throttling, and quota
* **Throttling and Rate Limits**: Prevent API abuse by limiting requests per second.
* **Deployment stages**: Dev, Staging, Prod, etc., with stage-specific settings.
* **Caching**: Built-in caching layer to reduce Lambda/API calls and improve performance.
* **Monitoring**: Integrated with CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and tracing (X-Ray).

## üß∞ 3. **Amazon DynamoDB ‚Äì Serverless NoSQL Database**

### üî∏ Overview:

* Fully managed **NoSQL key-value and document database**.
* Built for **single-digit millisecond** performance at any scale.
* Serverless, autoscaling, and no need to manage infrastructure.

### üî∏ Key Features:

* **Data Model**:

  * Tables, items, and attributes
  * Each item must have a **Primary Key** (partition key or composite key)
* **Capacity Modes**:

  * **On-Demand**: Pay-per-request.
  * **Provisioned**: Set read/write throughput, with optional auto-scaling.
* **Global Tables**: Multi-region replication for global apps.
* **DynamoDB Streams**: Captures item-level changes (insert/update/delete) and can trigger Lambda.
* **Indexing**:

  * **GSI (Global Secondary Index)** and **LSI (Local Secondary Index)** for flexible querying.
* **Security**:

  * IAM-based permissions
  * Encryption at rest (default)
* **Backup & Restore**:

  * Point-in-time recovery
  * On-demand backups
* **Monitoring**: Integrated with CloudWatch metrics and alarms.

## üîÑ 4. **AWS Step Functions ‚Äì Serverless Orchestration**

### üî∏ Overview:

* AWS Step Functions is a service to **coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows**.
* Uses **state machines** defined in Amazon States Language (ASL) (JSON-based).

### üî∏ Key Features:

* **Workflow orchestration**: Connect Lambda, DynamoDB, ECS, SQS, SNS, etc., in a series of steps.
* **Types of workflows**:

  * **Standard workflows**: Long-running, durable (up to 1 year), with full history.
  * **Express workflows**: High-volume, short-duration (up to 5 minutes), optimized for performance and cost.
* **Built-in error handling**: Retry and catch mechanisms for robust automation.
* **Visual workflow designer**: Helps build and monitor workflows.
* **Integration with SDKs and services**: Supports direct service integration without needing Lambda for simple calls.
* **Security**:

  * IAM roles per workflow
  * Encryption at rest and in transit
* **Use cases**:

  * Data pipelines
  * ETL jobs
  * Microservices orchestration
  * Long-running processes with wait/success/failure logic
