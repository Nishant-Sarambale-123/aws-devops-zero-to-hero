Here are **detailed notes** on the AWS **Storage Services** you mentioned ‚Äî **EBS, EFS, and Glacier** ‚Äî broken down into small, clear points for easy understanding and interview prep:

---

## ‚úÖ **1. EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

üóÑÔ∏è **Definition:**
Amazon EBS provides **block-level storage volumes** for use with **EC2 instances**. It behaves like a **virtual hard drive** attached to the instance.

---

### üîπ **Key Features:**

* Can attach to one EC2 instance at a time (except for **Multi-Attach** in io1/io2)
* Persistent storage (data remains even after EC2 is stopped)
* Can be used as root volume or additional data volumes
* Encrypted using AWS KMS
* Snapshots supported (stored in S3, point-in-time backup)

---

### üîπ **EBS Volume Types:**

| Type                        | Description              | Use Case                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **gp3**                     | General Purpose SSD      | Default choice for most workloads; consistent IOPS |
| **io2 / io2 Block Express** | Provisioned IOPS SSD     | High-performance, I/O-intensive apps (databases)   |
| **st1**                     | Throughput-optimized HDD | Big data, log processing (sequential access)       |

| Retrieval Time | Minutes to hours         | 12+ hours                   |
| Use Case       | Archive logs, compliance | Long-term backup (7+ years) |

---

### üîπ **Use Cases:**

* Long-term backups
* Compliance & regulatory data
* Archived medical records, financial reports

Would you like the **interview + scenario-based questions and answers** for these storage services next?

Here are the **interview** and **scenario-based questions with answers** for the AWS **Storage Services**: **EBS**, **EFS**, and **S3 Glacier**.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

### üîπ Interview Questions & Answers:

**Q1: What is Amazon EBS?**
**A:** Amazon EBS is block-level storage used with EC2. It provides persistent volumes that function like hard disks attached to instances.

**Q2: How does EBS differ from EFS?**
**A:**

* EBS is block storage and attaches to one EC2 at a time (except Multi-Attach).
* EFS is file storage and can be mounted to many EC2s at once.

**Q3: What are the volume types in EBS?**
**A:** gp3 (general purpose), io2/io1 (high IOPS), st1 (throughput-optimized), sc1 (cold HDD).

**Q4: What is an EBS snapshot?**
**A:** It's a point-in-time backup of a volume stored in S3. Snapshots are incremental and can be used to create new volumes.

**Q5: What happens to data on EBS when an instance is stopped or terminated?**
**A:**

* If root volume is not set to delete on termination, data persists.
* Stopping the instance does not delete the volume.

---

### üîπ Scenario-Based Q\&A:

**Q: You want to ensure that if an EC2 instance fails, you can restore it quickly with all data intact. What AWS feature will you use?**
**A:** Use **EBS snapshots** to regularly back up volumes. If an instance fails, launch a new instance using the saved AMI or create a volume from the snapshot.

---

## ‚úÖ **2. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

### üîπ Interview Questions & Answers:

**Q1: What is EFS and when would you use it?**
**A:** EFS is a shared file system accessible by multiple Linux-based EC2 instances. Use it when multiple instances need shared storage (e.g., web apps, CMS).

**Q2: Is EFS suitable for Windows instances?**
**A:** No, EFS supports only Linux-based instances.

**Q3: How does EFS scale?**
**A:** Automatically scales up and down as files are added or removed. No need to pre-provision capacity.

**Q4: What are the performance modes of EFS?**
**A:**

* General Purpose (default): low latency
* Max I/O: for higher throughput (with some latency)

**Q5: What are the throughput modes?**
**A:**

* Bursting mode: Based on file system size
* Provisioned mode: Fixed throughput regardless of size

---

### üîπ Scenario-Based Q\&A:

**Q: A web app is deployed across multiple EC2 instances and needs a common storage location for user uploads. What AWS service would you use?**
**A:** Use **EFS** to provide shared file storage across all EC2 instances.

---

## ‚úÖ **3. Amazon S3 Glacier**

### üîπ Interview Questions & Answers:

**Q1: What is S3 Glacier?**
**A:** It's a storage class in Amazon S3 designed for long-term archival of data at very low cost, but with high retrieval times.

**Q2: What are the different retrieval options in S3 Glacier?**
**A:**

* **Expedited** (1‚Äì5 min)
* **Standard** (3‚Äì5 hrs)
* **Bulk** (5‚Äì12 hrs)

**Q3: What's the difference between S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive?**
**A:**

* Glacier: Cheaper than S3 Standard, but faster than Deep Archive
* Deep Archive: Cheapest storage, retrieval time ‚â• 12 hours

**Q4: Can S3 Glacier be accessed like S3 Standard?**
**A:** No, Glacier data must first be restored before accessing.

**Q5: Is S3 Glacier encrypted?**
**A:** Yes, by default all data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.

---

### üîπ Scenario-Based Q\&A:

**Q: You need to archive 7 years of compliance logs with minimal cost, and access them only if an audit occurs. Which AWS service is suitable?**
**A:** Use **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** to store the logs ‚Äî cheapest storage class with sufficient retrieval time for archival data.
