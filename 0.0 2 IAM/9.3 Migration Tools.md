## üñ•Ô∏è **3. AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)**

*A tool to automate the migration of on-premises servers* (VMs) to AWS.

### üîπ Key Features:

* Supports **VMware**, **Hyper-V**, and **Microsoft Azure** virtual machines.
* Automates incremental **replication of live server volumes** to AWS.
* Creates AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) from on-prem servers.
* Agentless service ‚Äì no need to install anything on the source VMs.
* Integrated with AWS Migration Hub for central tracking.

### üîπ Use Cases:

* Lift-and-shift of on-prem server workloads
* Data center exit strategies
* Large-scale server fleet migration planning

Let me know if you'd like **interview questions or migration strategies** using these tools.

Here are **interview questions, answers, and scenario-based Q\&A** related to **AWS Migration Tools** ‚Äî **Snowball, DMS, and SMS** ‚Äî along with real-world **migration strategies**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Interview Questions and Answers**

### üîπ **1. What is AWS Snowball and when would you use it?**

**Answer:**
AWS Snowball is a physical, secure data transfer device used for transferring large volumes of data (typically in terabytes or petabytes) to AWS. It is useful when network transfer is too slow or expensive.
**Example Use Case:** Transferring 100 TB of video archive data from an on-premises data center.

---

### üîπ **2. What is the difference between Snowball and Snowball Edge?**

**Answer:**

* **Snowball** is primarily used for offline data transfer.
* **Snowball Edge** includes local compute and storage capabilities, so you can run AWS services like Lambda or EC2 on the device before transferring data to AWS.

---

### üîπ **3. What is AWS DMS and how does it help in database migration?**

**Answer:**
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps you migrate relational and NoSQL databases to AWS with minimal downtime. It supports both homogeneous (e.g., MySQL to MySQL) and heterogeneous (e.g., Oracle to PostgreSQL) migrations.

---

### üîπ **4. What is AWS SMS and how is it different from DMS?**

**Answer:**
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is used to migrate **whole servers or VMs**, not just databases. DMS is focused on **data within databases**, whereas SMS captures **server volumes** and converts them into Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for launch in EC2.

---

### üîπ **5. How does AWS ensure the security of data during a Snowball transfer?**

**Answer:**
Data is encrypted using 256-bit encryption keys managed via AWS KMS. Snowball devices are tamper-resistant and tamper-evident. All data is automatically erased from the device after transfer.

---

### üîπ **6. What tools would you use for migrating an Oracle database to Amazon Aurora?**

**Answer:**

* **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** to convert the schema.
* **AWS DMS** to replicate the data in real time.

---

## ‚úÖ **Scenario-Based Q\&A**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Scenario 1: Large Data Transfer**

**Question:** Your company needs to transfer 300 TB of backup data from an on-prem data center to AWS S3. The internet connection is slow and costly. What AWS migration tool would you use?

**Answer:**
Use **AWS Snowball Edge** for offline, physical data transfer. It allows large-scale migration securely and efficiently without depending on the internet.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Scenario 2: Database Migration with Minimal Downtime**

**Question:** You're tasked with migrating a MySQL database from your on-prem data center to Amazon RDS with minimal downtime. What approach would you take?

**Answer:**
Use **AWS DMS** with:

* **Full load migration**
* Followed by **ongoing replication (CDC - Change Data Capture)**
  This ensures minimal downtime during cutover.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Scenario 3: Lift-and-Shift of Application Servers**

**Question:** You need to migrate 100 on-prem virtual machines running on VMware to EC2 in AWS. What service will you use?

**Answer:**
Use **AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)** to automate the replication of VMs and create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Launch EC2 instances from the generated AMIs.

---

## üöÄ Migration Strategies

---

### üîπ **1. Offline Migration (Large datasets)**

* Use **Snowball or Snowball Edge** when:

  * Data exceeds 10 TB.
  * Internet bandwidth is limited or costly.
  * You require local processing before upload.

---

### üîπ **2. Live Database Migration (Low Downtime)**

* Use **AWS DMS** with:

  * Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) for heterogenous DBs.
  * Full data load + CDC for near-zero downtime.
* Monitor using DMS console and CloudWatch.

---

### üîπ **3. Lift-and-Shift Server Migration**

* Use **AWS SMS** for:

  * VMs running on VMware or Hyper-V.
  * Creating incremental replication jobs.
  * Coordinated cutover via AWS Migration Hub.

---

### üîπ **4. Hybrid Migration Strategy**

Combine:

* **Snowball** for bulk static data.
* **DMS** for live transactional databases.
* **SMS** for server/OS-level migration.

Example: First send large files via Snowball, then use DMS for transactional DB, then move VMs via SMS.
