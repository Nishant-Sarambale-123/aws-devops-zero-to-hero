## 📦 15. Content Delivery – Detailed Notes

---

### 🌍 **Amazon CloudFront (CDN - Content Delivery Network)**

**What it is:**
A fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users globally with low latency and high transfer speed.

---

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**

* **Edge Locations:**
  Global network of edge locations (over 400+ worldwide) to cache content closer to users.

* **Caching:**
  Frequently accessed content is cached at edge locations, reducing load on origin and speeding delivery.

* **Origin Sources:**
  CloudFront can pull content from:

  * S3 bucket
  * EC2 instance
  * Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
  * External (non-AWS) HTTP server

* **Security:**

  * **HTTPS support**
  * **Geo-restriction** – restrict access based on geographic location.
  * **Signed URLs / Signed Cookies** – restrict access to paid/premium content.
  * **Integration with AWS Shield and WAF** – for DDoS and application-level protection.

* **Content Types:**
  Delivers static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) and dynamic content (APIs, live streams, etc.).

* **Custom Domain Support:**
  You can use your own domain (e.g., `cdn.example.com`) with SSL certificates via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

* **Logging and Metrics:**
  Integrated with **CloudWatch** and **S3** for access logs and performance monitoring.

---

#### 🔸 **Use Cases:**

* Media delivery (videos, images)
* Accelerating static website
* API caching
* Secure delivery of software downloads

---

### 🛰️ **Amazon Route 53 (DNS + Traffic Management)**

**What it is:**
A highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that routes end-user requests to AWS resources or external websites.

---

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**

* **Domain Registration:**
  Register new domains directly from Route 53 (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.tech` etc.)

* **DNS Resolution:**
  Translates domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses used by computers.

* **Health Checks:**

  * Continuously monitors the health of specified endpoints (EC2, ELB, S3, etc.).
  * Can route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints.

* **Routing Policies:**

  1. **Simple Routing** – Routes to a single resource.
  2. **Weighted Routing** – Split traffic based on percentage weights.
  3. **Latency-Based Routing** – Direct traffic to region with lowest latency.
  4. **Failover Routing** – Switch to standby in case of primary failure.
  5. **Geolocation Routing** – Serve content based on user’s location.
  6. **Geoproximity Routing** – (with traffic bias) via Route 53 traffic flow.
  7. **Multi-Value Answer Routing** – Return multiple healthy records.

* **Integration:**
  Integrates seamlessly with:

  * CloudFront
  * S3 Static Website Hosting
  * Load Balancers
  * API Gateway

* **Private Hosted Zones:**
  For DNS resolution inside your VPC (used for internal DNS naming).

---

#### 🔸 **Use Cases:**

* Registering and hosting your domain name
* Routing traffic across AWS services and regions
* High availability with failover routing
* Blue-green deployments using weighted routing
* Reducing latency using latency-based routing

Here are **interview questions with answers** and **scenario-based use cases** for **AWS Content Delivery services** – **CloudFront** and **Route 53**:

---

## ✅ **CloudFront – Interview Questions & Answers**

### 🔸 Q1: What is Amazon CloudFront and how does it work?

**A:** CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that delivers content (web pages, images, videos, APIs) to users globally with low latency. It caches content at edge locations close to the user, reducing load on the origin server.

---

### 🔸 Q2: What are the origins supported by CloudFront?

**A:** CloudFront can fetch content from:

* Amazon S3
* EC2
* ELB
* AWS MediaPackage
* Custom origins (any HTTP/HTTPS web server)

---

### 🔸 Q3: How does CloudFront enhance security?

**A:** CloudFront supports:

* HTTPS delivery
* Geo-restriction
* Signed URLs and cookies
* AWS WAF for app-layer security
* AWS Shield for DDoS protection
* Access logging and origin access identity (OAI)

---

### 🔸 Q4: What are signed URLs and signed cookies?

**A:** These are methods to restrict access to private content served via CloudFront. Only users with valid credentials (signature) can access specific content.

---

### 🔸 Q5: Can CloudFront be used for dynamic content?

**A:** Yes, CloudFront supports both **static and dynamic** content. It can accelerate APIs, video streaming, and dynamic websites.

---

## 📘 **CloudFront – Scenario-Based Questions**

### 🔹 **Scenario 1: Video Streaming Performance**

**Q:** Your e-learning platform needs to deliver high-quality videos to users across the globe. How would you use AWS to ensure fast delivery and reduced latency?

**A:**

* Use **CloudFront** to cache and deliver videos via edge locations.
* Use **S3** as the origin for video files.
* Enable **signed URLs** to control access to premium content.
* Enable **logging** for usage tracking.
* Integrate **WAF** for additional security.

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2: API Acceleration**

**Q:** Your app’s backend is hosted in `us-east-1`, but users from India are complaining about slowness. How would you improve API speed?

**A:**

* Use CloudFront with the API Gateway or ELB as the origin.
* Enable caching of API responses if appropriate.
* Use **Geo-location** headers or routing to serve region-specific APIs if needed.

---

---

## ✅ **Route 53 – Interview Questions & Answers**

### 🔸 Q1: What is Route 53?

**A:** Route 53 is Amazon’s scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that routes users to applications hosted in AWS or outside. It supports domain registration, DNS resolution, health checks, and routing policies.

---

### 🔸 Q2: What routing policies are available in Route 53?

**A:**

1. **Simple**
2. **Weighted**
3. **Latency-based**
4. **Failover**
5. **Geolocation**
6. **Geoproximity**
7. **Multi-value answer**

---

### 🔸 Q3: How does Route 53 handle high availability?

**A:** By using **health checks** and **failover routing**, Route 53 can detect unhealthy endpoints and route traffic to backup resources automatically.

---

### 🔸 Q4: What is the difference between public and private hosted zones?

**A:**

* **Public Hosted Zone** – Used for publicly accessible domains.
* **Private Hosted Zone** – Used for internal DNS resolution within VPCs.

---

### 🔸 Q5: Can Route 53 be used for global routing?

**A:** Yes, using latency-based, geolocation, or geoproximity routing, you can direct users to the closest or most appropriate region.

---

## 📘 **Route 53 – Scenario-Based Questions**

### 🔹 **Scenario 1: Blue-Green Deployment**

**Q:** You want to test a new version of your app by sending only 10% of the traffic to it. How can you achieve this using Route 53?

**A:**

* Use **Weighted Routing**.
* Create two records for the same domain:

  * 90% weight to the old environment
  * 10% weight to the new one

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2: Disaster Recovery**

**Q:** How can you ensure users are automatically redirected to a backup server if your main application goes down?

**A:**

* Configure **Failover Routing** with health checks.
* Primary record routes to the main server.
* Secondary (failover) record points to backup server.
* If health check fails, Route 53 sends users to backup.

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 3: Regional Optimization**

**Q:** Your app is deployed in two AWS Regions – US and Asia. How can you ensure users are routed to the nearest region?

**A:**

* Use **Latency-Based Routing**.
* Route 53 will evaluate the lowest latency between the user and available endpoints and direct traffic accordingly.
