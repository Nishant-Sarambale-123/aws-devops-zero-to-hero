Here are **detailed notes** on the AWS **Storage Services** you mentioned — **EBS, EFS, and Glacier** — broken down into small, clear points for easy understanding and interview prep:

---

## ✅ **1. EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

🗄️ **Definition:**
Amazon EBS provides **block-level storage volumes** for use with **EC2 instances**. It behaves like a **virtual hard drive** attached to the instance.

---

### 🔹 **Key Features:**

* Can attach to one EC2 instance at a time (except for **Multi-Attach** in io1/io2)
* Persistent storage (data remains even after EC2 is stopped)
* Can be used as root volume or additional data volumes
* Encrypted using AWS KMS
* Snapshots supported (stored in S3, point-in-time backup)

---

### 🔹 **EBS Volume Types:**

| Type                        | Description              | Use Case                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **gp3**                     | General Purpose SSD      | Default choice for most workloads; consistent IOPS |
| **io2 / io2 Block Express** | Provisioned IOPS SSD     | High-performance, I/O-intensive apps (databases)   |
| **st1**                     | Throughput-optimized HDD | Big data, log processing (sequential access)       |
| **sc1**                     | Cold HDD                 | Lowest-cost, infrequent access workloads           |

---

### 🔹 **EBS Snapshots:**

* Point-in-time backup of an EBS volume
* Stored in Amazon S3 (not directly accessible like regular S3 objects)
* Can be used to create new EBS volumes
* Supports **incremental snapshots** (only changed blocks saved)

---

### 🔹 **Use Cases:**

* Boot volume for EC2
* Storage for databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Application or file system data

---

---

## ✅ **2. EFS (Elastic File System)**

🧰 **Definition:**
Amazon EFS is a **serverless, elastic, file-level storage system** that can be mounted to **multiple EC2 instances** (Linux only) **at the same time**.

---

### 🔹 **Key Features:**

* Fully **managed NFS** file system
* **Shared access** — can be accessed by thousands of EC2 instances
* **Automatic scaling** — no capacity planning required
* Data is stored across **multiple AZs**
* **POSIX-compliant** — supports standard Linux file system permissions
* Supports **encryption at rest and in transit**

---

### 🔹 **Performance Modes:**

* **General Purpose:** Default, low-latency (good for most apps)
* **Max I/O:** Supports higher throughput (higher latency)

---

### 🔹 **Throughput Modes:**

* **Bursting:** Default mode; performance scales with size
* **Provisioned:** Set a fixed throughput regardless of size

---

### 🔹 **Use Cases:**

* Shared storage between EC2s
* Web servers, CMS (e.g., WordPress)
* Development environments
* Big data analytics

---

---

## ✅ **3. Glacier (Now part of Amazon S3)**

🧊 **Definition:**
Amazon Glacier is a **low-cost archive storage** service for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for long durations.

---

### 🔹 **Key Characteristics:**

* Designed for **data archiving and backup**
* **Very low cost per GB**
* Data stored in **S3 Glacier** or **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
* **Not designed for frequent access** — retrieval takes time

---

### 🔹 **Retrieval Options:**

| Retrieval Tier | Time        | Use Case                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Expedited**  | 1–5 minutes | Urgent access                |
| **Standard**   | 3–5 hours   | Normal restore               |
| **Bulk**       | 5–12 hours  | Large, low-priority restores |

---

### 🔹 **S3 Glacier vs Deep Archive:**

| Feature        | S3 Glacier               | S3 Glacier Deep Archive     |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Cost           | Low                      | Lowest                      |
| Retrieval Time | Minutes to hours         | 12+ hours                   |
| Use Case       | Archive logs, compliance | Long-term backup (7+ years) |

---

### 🔹 **Use Cases:**

* Long-term backups
* Compliance & regulatory data
* Archived medical records, financial reports

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| **Service** | **Type**       | **Access**         | **Use Case**              |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **EBS**     | Block storage  | Attached to 1 EC2  | OS volumes, DB disks      |
| **EFS**     | File storage   | Shared across EC2s | Shared Linux storage, CMS |
| **Glacier** | Object archive | Restored via S3    | Long-term backups         |
