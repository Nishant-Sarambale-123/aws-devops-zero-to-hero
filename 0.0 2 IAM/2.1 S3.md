# üìò AWS S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) ‚Äì Detailed Notes

---

## 1. **Introduction**

* Fully managed **object storage service** by AWS.
* Stores and retrieves **any amount of data** from anywhere.
* Designed for **scalability, durability (11 9‚Äôs = 99.999999999%), and availability**.
* Data is stored as **objects** in **buckets**.

---

## 2. **Core Concepts**

### üîπ Buckets

* A **container** for objects (files).
* Globally unique name (DNS-compliant).
* Region-specific ‚Üí you choose region for data locality, latency, compliance.

### üîπ Objects

* Consist of:

  * **Key (name of object)**
  * **Value (data)**
  * **Metadata (system/user-defined)**
  * **Version ID (if versioning enabled)**

### üîπ Keys

* The unique identifier for an object (like file path).
* Example: `images/2025/photo.jpg`.

### üîπ Data Consistency

* **Strong consistency** for all operations (PUT, DELETE, LIST, etc.).

**Answer:**

* IAM Policies
* Bucket Policies
* Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* S3 Block Public Access
* Encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, Client-side encryption)
* VPC Endpoints (Private access without internet)

---

### 8. What is the maximum size of an S3 object?

**Answer:**

* Single upload limit ‚Üí 5 GB
* Maximum object size ‚Üí **5 TB** (via multipart upload)

---

### 9. What are Lifecycle Policies in S3?

**Answer:**
Rules that **automate transition and expiration** of objects.
Example: Move logs to Glacier after 30 days, delete after 1 year.

---

## üîπ **Advanced Questions**

### 10. What is S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?

**Answer:**
CRR automatically copies objects from one bucket to another **in a different AWS region**.

* Helps reduce cost when access is unpredictable.

---

### 13. How does S3 Select work?

**Answer:**
S3 Select lets you use **SQL queries** to retrieve only required data from objects (CSV, JSON, Parquet), instead of downloading the whole file. Saves bandwidth & processing cost.

---

### 14. How can you host a static website using S3?

**Answer:**

1. Create an S3 bucket (name = domain name).
2. Enable **static website hosting**.
3. Upload HTML/JS/CSS files.

**Answer:**

* **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** (lowest-cost, long-term storage, retrieval in hours).
* Use **Lifecycle rules** to transition automatically.

---

### 17. Scenario: Your S3 bucket accidentally became public. How do you fix it?

**Answer:**

1. Enable **Block Public Access**.
2. Review and update **Bucket Policy** and **IAM policies**.
3. Use **AWS Trusted Advisor** or **S3 Access Analyzer** to check for public exposure.

---
