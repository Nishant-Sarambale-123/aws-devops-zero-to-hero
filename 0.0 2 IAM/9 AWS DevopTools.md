## 🧰 **AWS Developer Tools – Detailed Notes**

---

### 🔹 **1. AWS CodeCommit** – *Source Control (Git-based Repository)*

#### ✅ What is it?

A **fully managed Git-based source control service** that lets you host secure and scalable private repositories.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Supports standard Git commands.
* Fully managed – no need to host Git servers.
* Encrypted at rest (KMS) and in transit (HTTPS/SSH).
* Fine-grained access control via **IAM**.
* Triggers: Can invoke AWS Lambda, SNS, or CloudWatch Events on repo changes.
* Supports large files and repositories.

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* Source code storage for applications.
* Triggering build/deploy pipelines automatically.
* Centralized code collaboration in secure AWS environment.

---

### 🔹 **2. AWS CodeBuild** – *Build & Test Service*

#### ✅ What is it?

A **fully managed continuous integration (CI) service** that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces build artifacts.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Supports common build environments (Java, Python, Node.js, Go, etc.).
* Custom build environments using Docker images.
* Pay-per-minute pricing (only pay for build time).
* Scales automatically.
* Integration with CodeCommit, S3, GitHub, Bitbucket.
* Can output artifacts to S3 or pass to CodeDeploy.

#### ✅ Buildspec File:

* `buildspec.yml` defines build steps (phases: install, pre\_build, build, post\_build).
* Located in source root or passed in config.

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* CI pipeline for building and testing apps.
* Automated packaging of Lambda or container apps.
* Run static code analysis or unit/integration tests.

---

### 🔹 **3. AWS CodeDeploy** – *Automated Deployment Service*

#### ✅ What is it?

A service that **automates application deployment** to:

* EC2 instances
* Lambda functions
* On-prem servers
* ECS (optional)

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Supports rolling updates, blue/green deployments.
* Tracks deployment status and logs.
* Lifecycle event hooks (BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, etc.).
* Uses `appspec.yml` to define deployment steps.
* Integrates with CodePipeline or standalone.

#### ✅ Deployment Types:

* **In-place**: Updates existing instances.
* **Blue/Green**: Spins up new environment, then shifts traffic.

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* EC2 instance fleet deployment.
* Lambda version deployments.
* Controlled, monitored updates with rollback options.

---

### 🔹 **4. AWS CodePipeline** – *CI/CD Orchestration*

#### ✅ What is it?

A **fully managed continuous delivery (CD) service** that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process.

#### ✅ Key Features:

* Integrates with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy.
* Can use 3rd-party tools (GitHub, Jenkins).
* Visual editor for pipeline stages.
* Event-driven (triggers on Git commits, build completion, etc.).
* Retry on failure, manual approvals, parallel actions supported.

#### ✅ Pipeline Stages:

* **Source** (e.g., CodeCommit)
* **Build** (e.g., CodeBuild)
* **Test** (optional)
* **Approval** (optional manual gate)
* **Deploy** (e.g., CodeDeploy)

#### ✅ Use Cases:

* End-to-end CI/CD pipeline automation.
* Production deployment with approvals and rollback.
* Custom workflows across hybrid or multi-account setups.

Let me know if you want:

* Sample `buildspec.yml` or `appspec.yml` files
* Interview questions based on these
* Scenario-based Q\&A

I can provide next.

Here’s your complete guide with:

1. ✅ **Sample `buildspec.yml` and `appspec.yml` files**
2. 🎯 **Interview Questions & Answers**
3. 🔍 **Scenario-based Q\&A**

## ✅ 1. Sample Files

### 📄 **Sample `buildspec.yml`** (used in **AWS CodeBuild**)

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 18
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - npm install
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Pre-build phase...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - npm run build
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
      - echo Uploading artifacts...

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  base-directory: dist/
```

🔹 **Explanation**:

* Defines **phases** of a build process.
* `artifacts` are copied from `dist/` (usually the build output folder) to S3.

---

### 📄 **Sample `appspec.yml`** (used in **AWS CodeDeploy** for EC2)

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/myapp
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/before_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/after_install.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_server.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ValidateService:
    - location: scripts/validate.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

🔹 **Explanation**:

* Specifies **lifecycle hooks** for deployment.
* Shell scripts are run in specific phases.
* Can be used for restarting services, DB migrations, validations, etc.

## 🎯 2. **Interview Questions with Answers**

### 🔸 Q1: What is the role of `buildspec.yml` in AWS CodeBuild?

**Answer**:
`buildspec.yml` is a YAML file that defines the sequence of commands AWS CodeBuild will execute. It includes phases like install, pre\_build, build, and post\_build, as well as output artifacts configuration.

---

### 🔸 Q2: How does CodeDeploy manage deployment steps?

**Answer**:
CodeDeploy uses an `appspec.yml` file that outlines:

* Where files will be copied (`files:` section).
* What scripts will run during deployment (`hooks:` section).
  Lifecycle events like `BeforeInstall`, `ApplicationStart`, and `ValidateService` allow custom operations at each phase.

---

### 🔸 Q3: Can CodePipeline work with GitHub instead of CodeCommit?

**Answer**:
Yes. CodePipeline supports external source repositories like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitHub Enterprise, and more. Webhooks or polling can be used to trigger pipelines on code changes.

---

### 🔸 Q4: What’s the difference between CodeDeploy in-place and blue/green deployments?

**Answer**:

* **In-place**: Code is deployed to existing instances, stopping the app briefly.
* **Blue/Green**: A new environment is spun up with the new version, and traffic is shifted gradually. Safer, but uses more resources.

---

### 🔸 Q5: What are some benefits of using AWS Developer Tools for CI/CD?

**Answer**:

* Fully managed
* Tight integration with AWS services
* IAM-based secure access
* Scales automatically
* Pay-as-you-go pricing

---

## 🔍 3. **Scenario-Based Questions with Answers**

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario 1: Build fails due to missing dependencies**

**Q**: Your CodeBuild project fails with an error like `command not found: npm`. What could be wrong?

**A**: Likely causes:

* The build environment is missing Node.js. Ensure the correct `runtime-versions:` is defined in `buildspec.yml`.

```yaml
runtime-versions:
  nodejs: 18
```

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario 2: Deployment succeeded but app doesn’t start**

**Q**: CodeDeploy finishes, but your app is not accessible. What might have gone wrong?

**A**:

* `ApplicationStart` or `AfterInstall` script failed or was misconfigured.
* The script may not start the service correctly.
* Logs in `/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root` can help debug.

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario 3: Blue/Green deployment rollback**

**Q**: In a blue/green deployment, how can you ensure traffic is rolled back if validation fails?

**A**:

* Use `ValidateService` hook in `appspec.yml` to run health checks.
* If the script fails, CodeDeploy stops and rolls back automatically (if configured).

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario 4: Secure access to CodeCommit**

**Q**: How do you ensure secure access to CodeCommit for developers?

**A**:

* Use IAM roles and users with Git credentials or SSH keys.
* Enable fine-grained IAM permissions on repositories.
* Use CodeCommit triggers for auditing or automated actions.
