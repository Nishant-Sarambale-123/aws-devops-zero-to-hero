Would you like me to also create **interview Q\&A grouped by these categories** (like DynamoDB-specific, RDS-specific, etc.)?
Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs build **AWS Databases Interview Q\&A**, grouped by categories so it‚Äôs easy to revise.

---

# üîπ 1. Relational Databases (RDS & Aurora)

**Q1. What is Amazon RDS?**

* A managed relational database service supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server.
* Provides backups, patching, scaling, Multi-AZ HA, read replicas.

**Q2. Difference between RDS and Aurora?**

* Aurora is AWS-built, MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible.
* Aurora is faster, auto-scales storage (up to 128 TB), has distributed storage across 3 AZs.
* RDS is traditional, Aurora is high-performance cloud-native.

**Q3. What is Multi-AZ vs Read Replica in RDS?**

* **Multi-AZ:** Synchronous replication for HA (standby for failover).
* **Read Replica:** Asynchronous replication for scaling reads (not HA).

---

# üîπ 2. Key-Value (DynamoDB)

**Q1. What is DynamoDB?**

* A fully managed NoSQL key-value/document DB.
* Millisecond latency, scales to millions of requests, serverless.

**Q2. DynamoDB vs RDS?**

* DynamoDB = NoSQL (schema-less, horizontal scaling).
* RDS = SQL (structured schema, vertical + read replicas scaling).

**Q3. What is DynamoDB DAX?**
