Here are detailed notes on IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS, with a clear breakdown of Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies, along with interview and scenario-based questions and answers.

üîê AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) ‚Äì Detailed Notes
IAM enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for users and applications.

üîπ 1. Users
Represents a person or service that needs access to AWS.
Can be assigned login credentials (password + MFA) and/or access keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK).
Example: Developer logging into AWS console or CI/CD tool using SDK.
üîπ 2. Groups
A collection of IAM users.
Policies attached to groups apply to all users in the group.
Easier to manage permissions for similar users (e.g., Developers, Admins).
üîπ 3. Roles
IAM roles are assumed by:

AWS services (like EC2, Lambda, ECS).
Users from another AWS account or identity provider (federation).
Roles have:

Temporary security credentials.
Trust policy (who can assume the role).
Permission policy (what it can do once assumed).
‚úÖ Common Use Cases:

EC2 assuming a role to access S3.
Cross-account access.
Federated identity via SAML/OIDC.
üîπ 4. Policies
Policies are JSON documents that define permissions (Allow/Deny).

Attached to:

Users
Groups
Roles
Types:

Managed Policies (AWS managed or customer-managed)
Inline Policies (embedded directly in a user/group/role)
üîê Key Elements of a Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
üîπ 5. Key IAM Features
Least privilege principle: Only give minimum required permissions.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds extra security.
IAM Access Analyzer: Identifies resources shared with external entities.
Service Control Policies (SCPs): For AWS Organizations, define max permissions.
‚úÖ Best Practices
Don‚Äôt use the root account for daily operations.
Enable MFA on all accounts.
Use IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, etc. instead of embedding credentials.
Rotate access keys regularly.
Audit with CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer.
üß† IAM Interview Questions and Answers
Q1: What is the difference between IAM Users and Roles? A:

Users: Permanent identity, tied to a person/application with long-term credentials.
Roles: Temporary identity, assumed by users/services, with short-lived credentials.
Q2: How can an EC2 instance access S3 securely? A:

Create an IAM role with S3 permissions.
Attach the role to the EC2 instance.
Applications on EC2 can now access S3 without keys.
Q3: What‚Äôs the difference between Inline and Managed policies? A:

Inline Policies: One-to-one attached to a specific user/group/role.
Managed Policies: Reusable and shareable across multiple IAM entities.
Q4: How do you implement cross-account access? A:

Create a role in Account A.
Add trust policy to allow Account B users to assume the role.
Use STS (Security Token Service) for temporary credentials.
Q5: What is a policy document in IAM? A: A JSON file that defines what actions are allowed/denied on what resources under which conditions.

üß© Scenario-Based IAM Questions and Answers
‚úÖ Scenario 1: EC2 needs S3 Access
Q: Your app on EC2 needs to read/write S3 objects. How do you do this securely? A:

Create an IAM role with s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject permissions.
Attach role to EC2 instance.
No need to store access keys.
‚úÖ Scenario 2: Developer needs read-only EC2 access
Q: You want to give a developer read-only EC2 access. What‚Äôs your approach? A:

Create an IAM group (e.g., EC2ReadOnly).
Attach AWS managed policy AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess.
Add developer‚Äôs IAM user to the group.
‚úÖ Scenario 3: Allow access to only one S3 bucket
Q: How do you restrict a user‚Äôs access to only one specific S3 bucket? A:

Create a policy like this:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
Attach to the user or group.
‚úÖ Scenario 4: Temporary access to support team
Q: You want to give support team temporary access to troubleshoot a resource. How? A:

Create a role with needed permissions.
Add trusted users/groups who can assume the role.
Support team uses sts:assume-role or IAM console to assume it.
‚úÖ Scenario 5: User needs access to one EC2 instance only
Q: A user must be able to stop/start only one EC2 instance. How do you do it? A:

Get the instance ARN.
Create a custom IAM policy:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:StartInstances",
    "ec2:StopInstances"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/instance-id"
}
Attach to the user.
