* **Types of workflows**:

  * **Standard workflows**: Long-running, durable (up to 1 year), with full history.
  * **Express workflows**: High-volume, short-duration (up to 5 minutes), optimized for performance and cost.
* **Built-in error handling**: Retry and catch mechanisms for robust automation.
* **Visual workflow designer**: Helps build and monitor workflows.
* **Integration with SDKs and services**: Supports direct service integration without needing Lambda for simple calls.
* **Security**:

  * IAM roles per workflow
  * Encryption at rest and in transit
* **Use cases**:

  * Data pipelines
  * ETL jobs
  * Microservices orchestration
  * Long-running processes with wait/success/failure logic

Let me know if you'd like **Q\&A** or **hands-on implementation examples** for these services next.

Here are **interview questions + scenario-based questions and answers** for the AWS **Serverless Services**: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **AWS Lambda ‚Äì Interview Q\&A**

### üîπ Q1: What is AWS Lambda?

**A:** Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.

### üîπ Q2: How is AWS Lambda priced?

**A:** Based on the number of requests and the duration of execution (measured in GB-seconds). First 1M requests/month are free.

### üîπ Q3: What are cold starts in Lambda?

**A:** Cold starts occur when a Lambda function is invoked after being idle, causing a slight delay while the environment is initialized.

---

### üß† Scenario:

**Q:** You need to run a background job whenever a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. How would you implement it using serverless?

**A:**

* Create an S3 bucket.
* Create a Lambda function that processes the file.
* Add an event notification on the bucket to trigger the Lambda on `s3:ObjectCreated`.
* Lambda automatically scales and handles execution on each upload.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **API Gateway ‚Äì Interview Q\&A**

### üîπ Q1: What is Amazon API Gateway?

**A:** A fully managed service to create, publish, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs for access to backend services like Lambda, EC2, etc.

### üîπ Q2: What are throttling and rate limiting in API Gateway?

**A:** Throttling controls how many requests a client can make per second. It helps prevent abuse and protects backend systems.

### üîπ Q3: How can you secure an API in API Gateway?

**A:** Use API Keys, IAM Roles, Lambda Authorizers, or Cognito User Pools.

---

### üß† Scenario:

**Q:** You want to expose a Lambda function to the public as an API endpoint. How do you do it?

**A:**

* Create an HTTP API using API Gateway.
* Integrate it with the Lambda function.
* Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., `/prod`).
* Apply CORS if needed.
* Provide the public URL for access.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **DynamoDB ‚Äì Interview Q\&A**

### üîπ Q1: What type of database is DynamoDB?

**A:** It is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides key-value and document data models.

### üîπ Q2: What is a partition key?

**A:** The partition key determines the physical location of the data and must be unique for each item in the table.

### üîπ Q3: What is the difference between GSI and LSI?

**A:**

* **GSI (Global Secondary Index)**: Can have different partition/sort keys than the main table.
* **LSI (Local Secondary Index)**: Shares the same partition key but different sort key.

---

### üß† Scenario:

**Q:** You need a database for a high-throughput e-commerce application that can scale automatically. How would you use DynamoDB?

**A:**

* Use DynamoDB with **On-Demand mode** to handle unpredictable traffic.
* Use **partition key = userID**, **sort key = orderDate**.
* Use **DynamoDB Streams** to trigger Lambda for real-time analytics or logging.
* Apply TTL and lifecycle policies if needed.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Step Functions ‚Äì Interview Q\&A**

### üîπ Q1: What are AWS Step Functions?

**A:** A service that lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows using state machines.

### üîπ Q2: What is the difference between Standard and Express workflows?

**A:**

* **Standard**: Durable, lasts up to 1 year, for long-running workflows.
* **Express**: Fast and cost-effective, runs up to 5 minutes, for high-volume, short-duration tasks.

### üîπ Q3: What are the benefits of using Step Functions over chaining Lambdas manually?

**A:**

* Built-in error handling and retries.
* Visual workflow management.
* Easier to maintain and audit logic.

---

### üß† Scenario:

**Q:** You want to build a serverless workflow where a file is processed in steps: validate, transform, and store. How would you design it?

**A:**

* Create 3 Lambda functions: validate(), transform(), store().
* Use AWS Step Functions to define a **state machine** with these steps.
* Add retry logic and fallback/error handlers.
* Trigger the state machine via API Gateway or S3 event.
