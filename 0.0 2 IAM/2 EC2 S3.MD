Here are **detailed notes** on the **Core AWS Services** you mentioned, broken down into **small, clear points** for easy understanding and interview preparation:

---

## ✅ **1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

🖥️ **Purpose:**
Amazon EC2 provides **resizable compute capacity** in the cloud. It allows you to launch and manage **virtual servers**, called **instances**, on-demand.

---

### 🔹 **Key Concepts:**

* **Instance = Virtual Machine (VM)**
* You can choose:

  * **Instance Type:** defines CPU, RAM, storage, network capacity (e.g., `t3.micro`, `m5.large`, `c5.xlarge`)
  * **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** preconfigured OS + software (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Windows)
  * **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** persistent disk for your instance

---

### 🔹 **Pricing Models:**

1. **On-Demand:**

   * Pay per hour/second
   * No commitment
   * Best for short-term or unpredictable workloads

2. **Reserved Instances:**

   * 1-year or 3-year commitment
   * Up to 75% cheaper than On-Demand
   * Ideal for steady workloads

3. **Spot Instances:**

   * Buy unused capacity at deep discounts
   * Can be terminated by AWS with 2 mins notice
   * Great for fault-tolerant or batch jobs

4. **Dedicated Hosts/Instances:**

   * Run on physical servers dedicated to your account
   * Required for licensing needs or compliance

---

   * Frequently accessed data
   * High performance and durability
2. **Standard-IA (Infrequent Access):**

   * Cheaper for data accessed less often
   * Retrieval fee applies
3. **One Zone-IA:**

   * Infrequent access in a **single AZ**
   * Less resilient
4. **Glacier:**

   * Archival storage (retrieval takes minutes to hours)
   * Low cost
5. **Glacier Deep Archive:**
