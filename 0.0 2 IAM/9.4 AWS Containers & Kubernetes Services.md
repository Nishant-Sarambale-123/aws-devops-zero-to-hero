## 🚢 13. Containers & Kubernetes (Detailed Notes)

AWS provides multiple container orchestration options to **build, deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications**. The key services are:

### ✅ Overview:

| Service     | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ECS**     | AWS-native container orchestration for Docker                   |
| **EKS**     | Managed Kubernetes control plane (CNCF-compliant)               |
| **Fargate** | Serverless compute engine for containers (used with ECS or EKS) |

---

## 🐳 1. **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

### 🔹 What is ECS?

A fully managed container orchestration service developed by AWS that supports Docker containers and lets you run applications without managing your own control plane.

### 🔹 Key Components:

* **Cluster**: A logical grouping of container instances or Fargate tasks.
* **Task Definition**: Blueprint for your application (container image, CPU, memory, ports, environment variables).
* **Service**: Defines how many copies (tasks) of your application should be running.
* **Task**: Running instance of a task definition.
* **Launch Types**:

  * **EC2 Launch Type**: You manage the EC2 infrastructure.
  * **Fargate Launch Type**: AWS manages infrastructure (serverless).

### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Running microservices with minimal Kubernetes expertise.
* Integration with **CodePipeline, CloudWatch, IAM**, etc.
* Companies already deep into the AWS ecosystem.

---

## ☸️ 2. **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**

### 🔹 What is EKS?

A **fully managed Kubernetes control plane**, compliant with the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. It lets you run Kubernetes without maintaining the master nodes.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Manages the **control plane (masters, etcd, API server)** automatically.
* You manage **worker nodes** (EC2 or Fargate).
* Supports native Kubernetes tools like `kubectl`, Helm, Kustomize.
* Integrates with IAM, CloudWatch, ALB Ingress Controller, etc.

### 🔹 Architecture:

* AWS hosts control plane across **multi-AZ for HA**.
* Worker nodes registered in **Auto Scaling Groups** or Fargate.
* Nodes communicate with control plane via secure endpoints.

### 🔹 Add-ons:

* **AWS VPC CNI Plugin** for native pod networking.
* **CoreDNS, kube-proxy** managed by EKS.
* Optional add-ons: Karpenter (autoscaling), OPA/Gatekeeper (policy), Fluent Bit (logging).

### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Enterprises migrating from self-managed Kubernetes.
* Hybrid cloud or multi-cloud deployments.
* Teams already using Kubernetes elsewhere.

---

## ⚙️ 3. **AWS Fargate**

### 🔹 What is Fargate?

A **serverless compute engine** that works with **ECS or EKS**, allowing you to run containers without provisioning or managing EC2 instances.

### 🔹 Features:

* **Pay per use** for CPU and memory resources.
* Works with **ECS Tasks** or **EKS Pods**.
* Eliminates need for node scaling, patching, or security maintenance.

### 🔹 Key Benefits:

* Simplified architecture (no EC2).
* Easy autoscaling.
* Secure by design: each task/pod runs in isolation.

### 🔹 Use Cases:

* Short-lived batch jobs.
* Low ops workloads (no infra maintenance).
* Development/testing environments.

---

## 🔐 IAM & Networking for Containers

* **IAM Roles for Tasks (ECS)** and **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (EKS)** allow fine-grained permissions to individual containers.
* **AWS App Mesh** provides service discovery and traffic control.
* Security is enhanced using **Security Groups**, **Task-level IAM**, and **EKS network policies**.

## 🧠 When to Use What?

| Scenario                                      | Use         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Want full control over Kubernetes             | **EKS**     |
| Want simple container management (AWS-native) | **ECS**     |
| Want zero infrastructure management           | **Fargate** |
| Running Kubernetes multi-cloud or hybrid      | **EKS**     |
| Prefer Docker and AWS-managed orchestration   | **ECS**     |

Here are **Interview and Scenario-Based Questions with Answers** for **Amazon ECS, EKS, and Fargate** — ideal for **DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Engineer roles**:

---

## 🧠 **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

### 🔸 Q1. What is ECS, and how does it differ from EKS?

**Answer:**
ECS is AWS's native container orchestration service. It simplifies deployment and scaling of containerized applications using Task Definitions and Services.
EKS, on the other hand, is a managed **Kubernetes** service that follows open-source standards.
Use ECS for tighter AWS integration and simplicity, and EKS when you need Kubernetes features or multi-cloud portability.

---

### 🔸 Q2. What are the main components of ECS?

**Answer:**

* **Cluster:** Logical group of container instances or tasks.
* **Task Definition:** Blueprint of a container (like Docker Compose).
* **Task:** Running instance of a task definition.
* **Service:** Ensures desired count of tasks are running.
* **Launch Types:** EC2 or Fargate.

---

### 🔸 Q3. How do you update a running ECS service?

**Answer:**
You update the **Task Definition version** and deploy the new revision to the ECS service. ECS performs a rolling update and ensures zero downtime if configured properly.

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario: ECS Fargate Task Failing Intermittently**

**Q:** A task on ECS Fargate crashes occasionally. Logs show memory errors. What do you check?

**A:**

* Inspect the **task definition**'s memory limits. If too low, increase it.
* Check **CloudWatch logs** for out-of-memory errors.
* If needed, enable **task-level logging and metrics**.
* Consider running tasks with **provisioned concurrency** if needed.

---

## ☸️ **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**

### 🔸 Q4. What is EKS and why would you use it?

**Answer:**
EKS is a fully managed **Kubernetes** control plane service. It simplifies running K8s clusters on AWS by handling control plane setup, upgrades, and availability. Ideal when:

* You’re migrating from on-prem K8s.
* You want CNCF-compliant orchestration.
* You need native `kubectl`, Helm, Kustomize support.

---

### 🔸 Q5. What networking model does EKS use?

**Answer:**
EKS uses **Amazon VPC CNI plugin** to assign **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** to pods, enabling **native VPC IP addresses** for each pod. This supports security groups per pod and VPC-level isolation.

---

### 🔸 Q6. How do you secure access to your EKS cluster?

**Answer:**

* Use **IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)**.
* Control API access via `aws-auth` ConfigMap.
* Enable RBAC for namespace/user segregation.
* Use **network policies**, Secrets encryption, and pod security policies.

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario: Pods Not Scaling in EKS**

**Q:** Your app pods are not scaling despite CPU hitting 90%. What would you troubleshoot?

**A:**

* Check **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** is configured with correct metrics.
* Verify **metrics-server** is installed and running.
* Ensure **Cluster Autoscaler** is enabled (if nodes are exhausted).
* Inspect pod limits and requests for CPU/memory.

---

## ⚙️ **Fargate**

### 🔸 Q7. What is AWS Fargate?

**Answer:**
Fargate is a **serverless compute engine** for containers. It works with ECS and EKS, allowing you to run containers without provisioning EC2 instances. You define CPU/memory, and AWS handles the rest.

---

### 🔸 Q8. How is Fargate different from EC2 launch type?

**Answer:**

| Feature        | EC2 Launch             | Fargate                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Infrastructure | You manage EC2         | AWS manages infra        |
| Billing        | Per EC2 instance       | Per task (CPU/RAM usage) |
| Scaling        | Manual or Auto Scaling | Serverless (automated)   |

---

### ⚙️ **Scenario: Migrating to Fargate**

**Q:** You're migrating an ECS service from EC2 to Fargate. What changes are needed?

**A:**

* Update the **launch type** in service to `FARGATE`.
* Ensure **network mode = awsvpc**.
* Define **CPU and memory** in the task definition.
* Assign **security groups and subnets** for networking.
* Test deployment and monitor in CloudWatch.

### 🔸 Q9. Can you run stateful workloads on ECS/EKS?

**Answer:**
Yes, but it's more common on EKS using **Kubernetes StatefulSets** with **Amazon EBS**. ECS can also use **EFS volumes**, but requires careful configuration for stateful apps.

---

### 🔸 Q10. How do ECS and EKS integrate with CI/CD?

**Answer:**

* **ECS** can deploy new versions via **CodePipeline + CodeDeploy**.
* **EKS** can use tools like **ArgoCD**, **Flux**, or **kubectl** with GitHub Actions/GitLab CI.
* Both support **Blue/Green and Canary deployments**.
