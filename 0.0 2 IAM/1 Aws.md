# 🔐 **AWS IAM – Detailed Notes**

---

## 1. ✅ **What is IAM?**

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is a global AWS service that lets you:

* **Control access** to AWS services and resources securely.
* Manage **who** can do **what**, **on which resources**, and **under which conditions**.
* Operates at the **account level**, not per-region.

---

## 2. 🧑‍💼 **IAM Users**

* Represent **individual people or applications**.
* IAM user = **name + credentials** (password and/or access keys).
* Can be used for **CLI, SDK**, or **AWS Console** access.

🛠️ **Example**: You create a user `dev-user1` with programmatic access to push data to S3.

---

## 3. 👥 **IAM Groups**

* A **collection of IAM users**.
* You attach **policies** to a group, and all users inherit those permissions.
* Helps in **simplifying permission management**.

🛠️ **Example**: A group `Developers` with `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` policy.

---

## 4. 🎭 **IAM Roles**

Roles allow **temporary, secure access** to AWS resources without long-term credentials.

🔑 **Key Concepts**:

* **Trusted Entity**: Who can assume the role (e.g., EC2, Lambda, another account).
* **Permissions Policy**: What the role can do.
* **STS (Security Token Service)**: Issues **temporary credentials** when a role is assumed.

✅ **Use Cases**:

* EC2 accessing S3 without access keys.
* Lambda invoking other AWS services.
* Cross-account access.
* Federation with Google Workspace, AD, or SAML.

---

## 5. 📜 **IAM Policies**

Policies define what **actions** are allowed or denied on **resources**.

They are written in **JSON** and can be attached to **users, groups, or roles**.

### 🎯 Policy Types:

| Policy Type      | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Managed      | Created and maintained by AWS (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`) |
| Customer Managed | Created by you; reusable                                   |
| Inline Policy    | Embedded in a single user/group/role; not reusable         |

### 🧩 Policy Structure:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
  }]
}
```

### 🧠 Policy Elements:

* **Effect**: Allow or Deny
* **Action**: Specific AWS operations (e.g., `ec2:StartInstances`)
* **Resource**: ARN of the resources
* **Condition** *(optional)*: Additional constraints like time, IP, MFA

---

## 6. 🔐 **Authentication and Authorization**

* **Authentication**: Validating identity (via passwords, access keys, MFA).
* **Authorization**: Verifying permissions using policies.

---

## 7. 🚪 **IAM Login Options**

| Access Type         | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Console Access      | Web login with username/password      |
| Programmatic Access | CLI/SDK using Access Key + Secret Key |
| Role-Based Access   | Temporary credentials via AssumeRole  |

---

## 8. 🧭 **IAM Conditions**

Policies can include **conditions** to fine-tune access:

* IP address (`aws:SourceIp`)
* MFA (`aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`)
* Time (`DateGreaterThan`, `DateLessThan`)
* Tags (`aws:RequestTag`, `aws:TagKeys`)

---

## 9. 🛠️ **Common IAM Use Cases**

* Give **developers** access to EC2 but not billing.
* Allow EC2 to access **S3 buckets** securely.
* Provide **temporary access** to third-party auditors.
* Enable **federated access** using Google or Microsoft accounts.
* Manage permissions **centrally** using groups and policies.

---

## 10. 🧰 **IAM Tools and Features**

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IAM Access Analyzer         | Shows who has access to your resources (e.g., S3 buckets shared externally) |
| IAM Policy Simulator        | Test what a policy allows or denies                                         |
| MFA                         | Extra security via OTP device                                               |
| Access Keys                 | For programmatic access to AWS services                                     |
| Roles with Session Duration | Temporary access for a specified time                                       |
| IAM Roles Anywhere          | Extend IAM role usage to on-prem servers (via certificates)                 |

---

## 11. 🔐 **IAM Security Best Practices**

1. ❌ **Don’t use root account** except for initial setup.
2. ✅ Enable **MFA** on root and privileged users.
3. 🚫 Avoid **inline policies** unless necessary.
4. 🔐 Rotate access keys regularly and monitor with **CloudTrail**.
5. ✅ Use **roles** for applications instead of hardcoding credentials.
6. 🧾 Apply **least privilege** – give minimum access needed.
7. 🧠 Audit regularly using **IAM Access Analyzer** and **CloudTrail**.
8. 🔄 Remove unused IAM users, keys, and policies.

---

## 12. 🧪 **IAM Real-World Examples**

### a. EC2 accessing S3

* Create a role with `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`.
* Attach it to EC2 instance.
* No need for access keys.

### b. Cross-account access

* Account A creates role with trust policy for Account B.
* Account B user assumes the role using STS.
* Permissions granted based on the attached policy.

### c. Restrict user to one EC2 instance

* Use policy with `Resource` set to specific EC2 instance ARN.
* Allow `ec2:StartInstances`, `ec2:StopInstances`.

---

## 13. 🧩 **IAM Policy with Conditions (Example)**

Allow S3 access only from specific IP and with MFA:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
    },
    "IpAddress": {
      "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔐 **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Detailed Notes**

IAM enables you to **securely control access** to AWS services and resources for users and applications.

---

### 🔹 1. **Users**

* Represents a **person or service** that needs access to AWS.
* Can be assigned **login credentials (password + MFA)** and/or **access keys** for programmatic access (CLI/SDK).
* Example: Developer logging into AWS console or CI/CD tool using SDK.

---

### 🔹 2. **Groups**

* A **collection of IAM users**.
* Policies attached to groups apply to **all users in the group**.
* Easier to manage permissions for similar users (e.g., Developers, Admins).

---

### 🔹 3. **Roles**

* IAM roles are assumed by:

  * **AWS services** (like EC2, Lambda, ECS).
  * **Users from another AWS account or identity provider** (federation).
* Roles have:

  * **Temporary security credentials**.
  * **Trust policy** (who can assume the role).
  * **Permission policy** (what it can do once assumed).

✅ Common Use Cases:

* EC2 assuming a role to access S3.
* Cross-account access.
* Federated identity via SAML/OIDC.

---

### 🔹 4. **Policies**

* Policies are **JSON documents** that define **permissions** (Allow/Deny).
* Attached to:

  * Users
  * Groups
  * Roles
* Types:

  * **Managed Policies** (AWS managed or customer-managed)
  * **Inline Policies** (embedded directly in a user/group/role)

🔐 **Key Elements of a Policy**:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Key IAM Features**

* **Least privilege principle**: Only give minimum required permissions.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra security.
* **IAM Access Analyzer**: Identifies resources shared with external entities.
* **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: For AWS Organizations, define max permissions.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* **Don’t use the root account** for daily operations.
* **Enable MFA** on all accounts.
* Use **IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, etc.** instead of embedding credentials.
* Rotate **access keys** regularly.
* Audit with **CloudTrail and IAM Access Analyzer**.

---

## 🧠 **IAM Interview Questions and Answers**

---

**Q1: What is the difference between IAM Users and Roles?**
**A:**

* Users: **Permanent identity**, tied to a person/application with long-term credentials.
* Roles: **Temporary identity**, assumed by users/services, with short-lived credentials.

---

**Q2: How can an EC2 instance access S3 securely?**
**A:**

* Create an **IAM role** with S3 permissions.
* Attach the role to the EC2 instance.
* Applications on EC2 can now access S3 **without keys**.

---

**Q3: What’s the difference between Inline and Managed policies?**
**A:**

* **Inline Policies**: One-to-one attached to a specific user/group/role.
* **Managed Policies**: Reusable and shareable across multiple IAM entities.

---

**Q4: How do you implement cross-account access?**
**A:**

* Create a **role in Account A**.
* Add **trust policy** to allow Account B users to assume the role.
* Use **STS (Security Token Service)** for temporary credentials.

---

**Q5: What is a policy document in IAM?**
**A:**
A **JSON file** that defines what actions are allowed/denied on what resources under which conditions.

---

## 🧩 **Scenario-Based IAM Questions and Answers**

---

### ✅ Scenario 1: EC2 needs S3 Access

**Q: Your app on EC2 needs to read/write S3 objects. How do you do this securely?**
**A:**

* Create an IAM role with `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject` permissions.
* Attach role to EC2 instance.
* No need to store access keys.

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Developer needs read-only EC2 access

**Q: You want to give a developer read-only EC2 access. What’s your approach?**
**A:**

* Create an IAM group (e.g., `EC2ReadOnly`).
* Attach AWS managed policy `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`.
* Add developer’s IAM user to the group.

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: Allow access to only one S3 bucket

**Q: How do you restrict a user’s access to only one specific S3 bucket?**
**A:**

* Create a policy like this:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
```

* Attach to the user or group.

---

### ✅ Scenario 4: Temporary access to support team

**Q: You want to give support team temporary access to troubleshoot a resource. How?**
**A:**

* Create a **role** with needed permissions.
* Add **trusted users/groups** who can assume the role.
* Support team uses `sts:assume-role` or IAM console to assume it.

---

### ✅ Scenario 5: User needs access to one EC2 instance only

**Q: A user must be able to stop/start only one EC2 instance. How do you do it?**
**A:**

* Get the **instance ARN**.
* Create a custom IAM policy:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:StartInstances",
    "ec2:StopInstances"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/instance-id"
}
```

* Attach to the user.
