Here are **detailed interview questions and answers on Load Balancer**, especially with an **AWS focus**, which are frequently asked in Cloud, DevOps, and Solution Architect roles:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **What is a Load Balancer?**

**Answer:**
A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple backend targets (like EC2 instances, containers, IPs) to:

* Improve application **availability**
* Achieve **fault tolerance**
* Enable **horizontal scalability**
* **Avoid overloading** a single server

**Key Points to Mention:**

* Works on **Layer 4 (Transport)** or **Layer 7 (Application)**
* Performs **health checks**
* Automatically removes **unhealthy targets**
* Supports **SSL termination**, **autoscaling**, and **multi-AZ**

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **What are the types of Load Balancers in AWS?**

**Answer:**

| Load Balancer                       | Layer                 | Use Case                        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)  | Web apps, microservices         |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**     | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS) | Real-time, low latency          |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**    | Layer 3               | Security appliances (firewalls) |
| **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**     | Layer 4 & 7           | Legacy support                  |

üëâ **Mention**: ALB for content-based routing, NLB for high-performance apps, GWLB for inline appliances.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **What is the difference between ALB and NLB?**

| Feature    | ALB                     | NLB                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Layer      | 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)          | 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS)                     |
| Protocols  | HTTP, HTTPS             | TCP, UDP, TLS                       |
| Routing    | Path/Host-based         | IP/Port-based                       |
| IP Support | DNS only                | Static & Elastic IP                 |
| Use Case   | Web apps, microservices | Real-time, gaming, IoT, low-latency |

üìå **Example:** Use ALB for routing `/login` and `/images`, NLB for real-time chat apps.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **What is Path-Based and Host-Based Routing in ALB?**

**Answer:**

* **Path-based Routing:** Routes based on URI path (e.g., `/api/*` ‚Üí target group A, `/images/*` ‚Üí target group B).
* **Host-based Routing:** Routes based on hostname (e.g., `admin.yoursite.com` ‚Üí admin servers).

**Used for:**

* Microservices
* Multi-tenant applications
* Hosting multiple domains/subdomains

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **What are Listeners and Target Groups in ELB?**

**Answer:**

* **Listener:** A process that checks for connection requests (e.g., port 80, 443). It defines **protocol + port**.
* **Target Group:** A group of registered resources (like EC2 instances) to which traffic is forwarded.

Each listener is associated with a target group and **rules** (especially in ALB).

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **How does Health Check work in Load Balancer?**

**Answer:**
Health Checks are periodic requests sent by the load balancer to backend targets to monitor their status.

**Parameters:**

* **Protocol & Path**: (e.g., HTTP `/health`)
* **Healthy threshold**
* **Unhealthy threshold**
* **Timeout and Interval**

**If a target fails the health check:**

* It is **marked as unhealthy**
* No traffic is sent to it until it passes again

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Can Load Balancer perform SSL termination?**

**Answer:**
Yes. Load Balancers (ALB, NLB with TLS) can **terminate SSL** by decrypting HTTPS traffic at the load balancer.

**Benefits:**

* Offloads SSL work from backend
* Simplifies certificate management
* Backend only sees HTTP (not HTTPS)

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **What is a Sticky Session? How is it handled in ELB?**

**Answer:**

Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity) bind a user‚Äôs session to a specific backend instance.

**AWS Implementation:**

* Enabled using **Cookies**
* CLB & ALB support it using **Duration-based cookies** or **Application-generated cookies**

**Use Case:**

* Stateful apps that store session data locally (not ideal for scalability)

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **How is Load Balancer used in Auto Scaling?**

**Answer:**
Load Balancer is integrated with **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** to:

* Automatically register new instances
* Deregister terminated instances
* Distribute traffic across scaling instances

‚û°Ô∏è It ensures **seamless scaling and zero-downtime deployment**

---

### ‚úÖ 10. **Can ALB handle WebSocket connections?**

**Answer:**
Yes, **ALB supports WebSocket** and HTTP/2.

**Use Cases:**

* Real-time applications
* Chat servers
* Live streaming apps

---

### ‚úÖ 11. **What‚Äôs the difference between Internal and Internet-Facing Load Balancer?**

| Type                    | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internet-facing ELB** | Has public IP/DNS, used to route traffic from the internet                                |
| **Internal ELB**        | Only accessible inside the VPC, used for backend communication (microservices, databases) |

---

### ‚úÖ 12. **What happens if all targets in a target group fail health checks?**

**Answer:**

* Load Balancer will consider all targets **unavailable**
* Client requests will either:

  * Be **dropped**
  * Or receive **5xx errors** (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable)
* This may trigger **Auto Scaling** to bring new healthy instances

---

### ‚úÖ 13. **How to enable HTTPS using Load Balancer in AWS?**

**Steps:**

1. Create an SSL certificate using **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**
2. Add a **listener** on port 443 (HTTPS)
3. Attach SSL certificate to the listener
4. Optionally use **SSL policies** for security compliance

---

### ‚úÖ 14. **Difference Between Classic Load Balancer and ALB/NLB?**

| Feature        | CLB         | ALB/NLB                       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Protocols      | HTTP, TCP   | ALB: HTTP/HTTPS, NLB: TCP/UDP |
| Layer          | Layer 4 & 7 | ALB: 7, NLB: 4                |
| Target Types   | Only EC2    | EC2, IPs, Lambda, ECS         |
| Modern Support | Legacy      | Recommended for new apps      |

---

### ‚úÖ 15. **What is Cross-Zone Load Balancing?**

**Answer:**
Enables load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across all registered targets in all AZs, not just those in the same zone as the request.

* **Enabled by default for ALB**
* **Optional for NLB**

**Helps:**

* With better **distribution**
* Avoids **zonal imbalance**
