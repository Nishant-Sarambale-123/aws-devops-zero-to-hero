## 🔸 **CloudWatch Metrics**

* **Definition**: Numeric data points about resources or applications, collected at **1-minute** or **custom intervals**.
* **Examples**:

  * EC2: CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps
  * S3: NumberOfObjects
  * Lambda: Invocations, Duration, Errors
* **Dimensions**: Attributes to filter metrics (e.g., InstanceId, AutoScalingGroupName).
* **Namespaces**: Logical containers (e.g., `AWS/EC2`, `AWS/S3`, `AWS/Lambda`, `Custom`).
* **Retention**:

  * 1-minute data: 15 days
  * 5-minute data: 63 days
  * 1-hour data: 455 days

### ❗Custom Metrics:

* You can publish your own metrics using:

  * AWS CLI
  * SDKs
  * CloudWatch agent
* Charged based on data points.

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Alarms**

* **Definition**: Watch a single metric or math expression.
* **States**: `OK`, `ALARM`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
* **Actions**:

  * Trigger SNS
  * Auto Scale EC2 instances
  * Stop/terminate/recover EC2
  * Invoke Lambda

### 🛠 Example Use Cases:

* Alarm if CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
* Send email via SNS if S3 bucket has too many errors
* Automatically recover EC2 if it becomes unresponsive

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Logs**

* **Log Groups**: Container for log streams.
* **Log Streams**: Sequence of log events from a single source.
* **Retention**: Can be set per log group (default: never expire).
* **Use Cases**:

  * Centralized logs from EC2, Lambda, RDS, VPC, ECS
  * Custom app logs
  * Troubleshooting and auditing

### 🧰 Integration Options:

* **CloudWatch Agent** (EC2, on-prem servers)
* **Lambda Logging** (`console.log()` goes to CloudWatch)

* **VPC Flow Logs**

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Agent**

* Used to collect:

  * Custom metrics (e.g., disk space, memory)
  * Logs (e.g., /var/log/syslog)
* Runs on:

  * EC2 (Linux/Windows)
  * On-prem servers
* Installed via SSM or manually.

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Dashboards**

* Custom visualizations for metrics and logs.

* Supports sharing across accounts (Cross-Account Dashboards).

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Logs Insights**

* Powerful **log analytics tool**.
* Query syntax like SQL.
* Use case: filter logs, calculate trends, error tracking.

### 📌 Example Query:

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Contributor Insights**

* Identifies **top contributors** to metrics.
* Visualizes spikes or patterns by analyzing structured logs.
* Helps detect anomalies, e.g., which IP is sending most requests.

---

## 🔸 **CloudWatch Events (Now Amazon EventBridge)**

* Delivers a stream of **real-time events**.
* Automatically responds to state changes in AWS resources.
* Example:

  * When an EC2 instance starts, trigger Lambda.
  * Schedule a Lambda function every 6 hours (cron support).

# 🌩️ AWS CloudWatch – Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 1. **What is CloudWatch and how is it used?**

* **Definition:** CloudWatch is AWS’s **monitoring & observability service** for AWS, hybrid, and on-prem systems.
* **Uses:**

  * Collect **metrics** (CPU, latency, network, custom).
  * Collect **logs** (application/system logs).
  * Create **alarms** (take action on thresholds).
  * Build **dashboards** (visualizations).
  * Integrate with **Auto Scaling, SNS, Lambda** for automation.

---

## 2. **How do CloudWatch Logs and Metrics differ?**

| Feature       | CloudWatch Metrics                     | CloudWatch Logs                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Data Type** | Numeric (CPU %, latency, requests/sec) | Text (app/system logs)              |
| **Source**    | AWS services, custom metrics, agent    | Applications, OS logs               |
| **Use Case**  | Performance monitoring                 | Debugging, auditing, error tracking |
| **Retention** | 15 months                              | Configurable (retention policies)   |

---

## 3. **What are CloudWatch Alarms and their states?**

* **Alarm:** A rule that monitors a metric or expression and triggers an action.
* **States:**

  * **OK** → Metric within threshold.
  * **ALARM** → Threshold breached.
  * **INSUFFICIENT\_DATA** → Not enough data.
* **Actions:** SNS notifications, Auto Scaling, Lambda execution.

---

## 4. **How does CloudWatch integrate with Auto Scaling?**

* CloudWatch Alarms **trigger Auto Scaling policies**.

  * Example: If `CPU > 80%` → add instance.
  * If `CPU < 20%` → remove instance.
* Ensures **elastic scaling** of workloads.

---

## 5. **How do you monitor memory or disk usage in EC2 using CloudWatch?**

* EC2 **default metrics don’t include memory/disk**.
* To monitor them:

  1. Install **CloudWatch Agent** on EC2.
  2. Configure `amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`.
  3. Agent pushes memory/disk metrics to CloudWatch.

---

## 6. **Difference between CloudWatch Events and CloudTrail?**

| Feature         | CloudWatch Events (EventBridge)  | CloudTrail                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Real-time event bus              | API call auditing                       |
| **Focus**       | Detects **state changes/events** | Logs **who did what, when, from where** |
| **Example**     | Trigger Lambda when EC2 stops    | Log when `StopInstances` API was called |
| **Integration** | SNS, Lambda, Step Functions      | S3, CloudWatch Logs                     |

👉 CloudTrail = **audit log**, CloudWatch Events = **real-time trigger**.

---

## 7. **What is the purpose of Contributor Insights?**

* Analyzes logs/metrics to find **top contributors**.
* Example:

  * Top 10 IPs generating traffic.
  * Top 5 users causing throttling errors.
* Helps in **performance troubleshooting** and **security monitoring**.

---

## 8. **How do you reduce cost in CloudWatch logging?**

* **Ways:**

  * Set **log retention policies**.
  * Filter to ingest only **necessary logs**.
  * Send logs to **S3** and query with Athena.
  * Use **Logs Insights** instead of exporting.
  * Aggregate **custom metrics** (avoid too many).

---

## 9. **Can you monitor on-prem servers with CloudWatch?**

✅ Yes.

* Install **CloudWatch Agent** on on-prem servers.
* Push logs/metrics to CloudWatch.
* Useful for **hybrid monitoring** setups.

---

## 10. **Explain the CloudWatch Agent configuration process.**

1. **Install agent** (`yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent` on Linux / MSI for Windows).
2. **Generate config file** using:

   ```
   amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
   ```
3. **Fetch and apply config:**

   ```
   amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json -s
   ```
4. Metrics & logs flow into CloudWatch.

---

## 11. **Other Important CloudWatch Features (often asked):**

### 🔹 **CloudWatch Logs Insights**

* Run **SQL-like queries** on logs.
* Example:

  ```sql
  fields @timestamp, @message
  | filter @message like /ERROR/
  | sort @timestamp desc
  | limit 10
  ```
* Useful for **troubleshooting** without exporting logs.

---

### 🔹 **CloudWatch Dashboards**

* Custom **visualization panels**.
* Combine metrics, alarms, and widgets in one place.
* Can show **multi-account, multi-region data**.

---

### 🔹 **High-resolution Custom Metrics**

* 1-second granularity (vs default 1-min).
* Paid feature → useful for **real-time apps, trading systems**.

---

### 🔹 **Cross-account Observability**

* Monitor **multiple AWS accounts** in one CloudWatch dashboard.
* Useful in **multi-account architectures**.

---

### 🔹 **CloudWatch Anomaly Detection**

* Uses **machine learning** to detect abnormal patterns in metrics.
* Example: Automatically alert if traffic spikes unexpectedly (even if within thresholds).
