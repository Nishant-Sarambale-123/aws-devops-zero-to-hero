## ‚úÖ **What is Amazon CloudWatch?**

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a **monitoring and observability service** built for DevOps engineers, developers, SREs, and IT managers. It provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, understand system-wide performance, and optimize resource utilization.

## üîπ **Key Features of CloudWatch**

| Feature                  | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metrics**              | Time-series data about resource performance.      |
| **Alarms**               | Notify when metric breaches threshold.            |
| **Logs**                 | Store, monitor, and analyze log data.             |
| **Events (EventBridge)** | React to events from AWS services or custom apps. |
| **Dashboards**           | Visualize metrics in real-time.                   |
| **CloudWatch Agent**     | Collects OS-level metrics and logs.               |

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Metrics**

* **Definition**: Numeric data points about resources or applications, collected at **1-minute** or **custom intervals**.
* **Examples**:

  * EC2: CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps
  * S3: NumberOfObjects
  * Lambda: Invocations, Duration, Errors
* **Dimensions**: Attributes to filter metrics (e.g., InstanceId, AutoScalingGroupName).
* **Namespaces**: Logical containers (e.g., `AWS/EC2`, `AWS/S3`, `AWS/Lambda`, `Custom`).
* **Retention**:

  * 1-minute data: 15 days
  * 5-minute data: 63 days
  * 1-hour data: 455 days

### ‚ùóCustom Metrics:

* You can publish your own metrics using:

  * AWS CLI
  * SDKs
  * CloudWatch agent
* Charged based on data points.

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Alarms**

* **Definition**: Watch a single metric or math expression.
* **States**: `OK`, `ALARM`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
* **Actions**:

  * Trigger SNS
  * Auto Scale EC2 instances
  * Stop/terminate/recover EC2
  * Invoke Lambda

### üõ† Example Use Cases:

* Alarm if CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
* Send email via SNS if S3 bucket has too many errors
* Automatically recover EC2 if it becomes unresponsive

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Logs**

* **Log Groups**: Container for log streams.
* **Log Streams**: Sequence of log events from a single source.
* **Retention**: Can be set per log group (default: never expire).
* **Use Cases**:

  * Centralized logs from EC2, Lambda, RDS, VPC, ECS
  * Custom app logs
  * Troubleshooting and auditing

### üß∞ Integration Options:

* **CloudWatch Agent** (EC2, on-prem servers)
* **Lambda Logging** (`console.log()` goes to CloudWatch)
* **ECS, Fargate Logging** via FireLens or awslogs driver
* **VPC Flow Logs**

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Agent**

* Used to collect:

  * Custom metrics (e.g., disk space, memory)
  * Logs (e.g., /var/log/syslog)
* Runs on:

  * EC2 (Linux/Windows)
  * On-prem servers
* Installed via SSM or manually.

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Dashboards**

* Custom visualizations for metrics and logs.
* Can include:

  * Line graphs
  * Number displays
  * Text widgets
* Dashboard data is **region-specific**.
* Supports sharing across accounts (Cross-Account Dashboards).

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Logs Insights**

* Powerful **log analytics tool**.
* Query syntax like SQL.
* Use case: filter logs, calculate trends, error tracking.

### üìå Example Query:

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Contributor Insights**

* Identifies **top contributors** to metrics.
* Visualizes spikes or patterns by analyzing structured logs.
* Helps detect anomalies, e.g., which IP is sending most requests.

---

## üî∏ **CloudWatch Events (Now Amazon EventBridge)**

* Delivers a stream of **real-time events**.
* Automatically responds to state changes in AWS resources.
* Example:

  * When an EC2 instance starts, trigger Lambda.
  * Schedule a Lambda function every 6 hours (cron support).

## üî∏ **CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs X-Ray**

| Feature     | CloudWatch          | CloudTrail                | X-Ray                   |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Monitoring & Logs   | API activity logs         | App trace analysis      |
| **Level**   | Metrics & OS logs   | Management-level API logs | App-level tracing       |
| **Example** | CPU usage, disk I/O | Who started EC2           | Trace user request flow |

---

## üî∏ **Common CloudWatch Metrics by AWS Service**

| Service         | Common Metrics                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
