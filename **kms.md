Here are **AWS KMS notes in clear, simple *point-wise*** format:

---

## **AWS KMS Notes — Point Wise**

### **Basics**

* KMS stands for **Key Management Service**.
* It is a **fully managed** AWS service for creating and controlling encryption keys.
* Uses **FIPS-140-2 compliant HSMs** to protect keys.
* Keys **never leave KMS** in plaintext.

---

### **Types of Keys**

* **AWS-managed keys**

  * Automatically created by AWS services (S3, EBS, RDS).
  * Minimal control, no customization.
* **Customer-managed keys (CMK / KMS keys)**

  * Created and controlled by customers.
  * Supports key rotation, custom policies, cross-account use.
* **Customer-managed asymmetric keys**

  * Used for digital signatures, SSH, and public/private encryption.
* **Data keys**

  * Generated by KMS but used by applications to encrypt large data locally.

---

### **How KMS Works**

* KMS key encrypts only small data (like data keys).
* For large files, KMS generates a **data key** → app uses it to encrypt data → encrypted data key is stored with data.
* During decryption, KMS decrypts only the data key, not the whole data.

---

### **Key Rotation**

* Automatic rotation available **every 1 year** for customer-managed keys.
* When rotated, new key versions are created under the same logical key.
* Old versions remain active for decryption of old data.

---

### **Access Control**

* Uses **IAM policies**, **Key policies**, and **Grants**.
* **Key policy** is the primary permission layer.
* **Grants** allow temporary or service-specific key access.

---

### **KMS Integrations**

* Works with most AWS services like S3, EBS, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS.
* Allows **envelope encryption** automatically in many services.

---

### **Security Features**

* Keys stored in secure HSMs.
* Audit logs available via **CloudTrail**.
* Keys can be disabled or scheduled for deletion (7–30 days).

---

### **Multi-region Keys**

* Lets you replicate keys across regions.
* Helps in cross-region disaster recovery and global apps.

---

### **Use Cases**

* Encrypting data at rest (S3, EBS volumes).
* Encrypting sensitive values in applications.
* Signing and verifying data with asymmetric keys.
* Managing secrets indirectly (used by Secrets Manager and SSM Parameter Store).

---

### **Key Takeaways**

* KMS is central to AWS encryption.
* Gives strong security without managing hardware.
* Customer-managed keys offer full control, rotation, and cross-account usage.
