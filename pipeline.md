# ✅ **AWS CodePipeline - Detailed Notes**

---

## 🔷 **What is AWS CodePipeline?**

AWS CodePipeline is a **fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service** that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process every time there is a code change.

---

## 🔷 **Key Concepts**

### 1. **Pipeline**

* A pipeline is a **workflow** that defines how your code changes go through different stages (e.g., Source → Build → Test → Deploy).
* Each pipeline has:

  * **Stages**
  * **Actions**
  * **Transitions**

### 2. **Stage**

* A stage is a **logical unit of the pipeline**.
* Examples: Source, Build, Test, Approve, Deploy.
* Each stage contains one or more **actions**.

### 3. **Action**

* An action is a task performed in a stage.
* **Types of actions**:

  * Source (e.g., GitHub, CodeCommit)
  * Build (e.g., CodeBuild, Jenkins)
  * Test (e.g., CodeBuild)
  * Deploy (e.g., CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, CloudFormation)
  * Approval (manual approval)
  * Invoke (AWS Lambda)

### 4. **Action Provider**

* The service that performs the action.

  * Examples: CodeCommit (source), CodeBuild (build), CodeDeploy (deploy), Lambda (invoke).

### 5. **Transitions**

* Pipelines move code between stages using **transitions**.
* Can be **enabled or disabled** manually or automatically.

## 🔷 **Common AWS Services Integrated with CodePipeline**

| Service            | Purpose                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| CodeCommit         | Source control                    |
| CodeBuild          | Build and Test                    |
| CodeDeploy         | Application Deployment            |
| S3                 | Source artifact or output storage |
| Lambda             | Custom actions or notifications   |
| CloudFormation     | Infrastructure deployment         |
| GitHub / Bitbucket | Source repository (via webhook)   |
| SNS                | Notifications                     |
| IAM                | Permissions & role management     |

## 🔷 **How CodePipeline Works**

1. **Source Change**

   * Triggered by a commit or push to a source repository (e.g., CodeCommit or GitHub).

2. **Pipeline Execution Starts**

   * The pipeline automatically starts and moves the artifacts through the defined stages.

3. **Each Stage Executes in Order**

   * Example: Source → Build → Test → Approval → Deploy

4. **Manual Approval (Optional)**

   * Requires human intervention before proceeding.

5. **Artifacts**

   * Every action can take input/output **artifacts** (files, packages, zipped source code, etc.).

---

## 🔷 **Pipeline Artifacts**

* Artifacts are **files** passed between pipeline actions.
* Stored in **Amazon S3**.
* Input Artifact: Used as input for an action.
* Output Artifact: Created by an action and passed to the next.

---

## 🔷 **Pipeline Structure - JSON or YAML**

You can define a pipeline using:

* **AWS Console**
* **AWS CLI**
* **CloudFormation**
* **CodePipeline JSON/YAML definitions**

Example structure:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "MyPipeline",
    "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/CodePipelineServiceRole",
    "artifactStore": {
      "type": "S3",
      "location": "my-pipeline-artifact-bucket"
    },
    "stages": [
      {
        "name": "Source",
        "actions": [...]
      },
      {
        "name": "Build",
        "actions": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## 🔷 **Manual Approval Actions**

* Used to pause the pipeline.
* Needs a **human to approve**.
* Can be integrated with **SNS** to notify approvers.

---

## 🔷 **Event Triggers**

* Pipelines can be triggered by:

  * Code commits (via webhooks)
  * Manual triggers
  * Amazon CloudWatch Events

---

## 🔷 **Pipeline Execution Types**

| Type             | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Source-triggered | Automatically triggered by source change |
| Manual           | Started manually from console or CLI     |
| Retry            | Retry of a failed execution              |

---

## 🔷 **Important Features**

### ✅ Parallel Actions

* Multiple actions within a stage can run **in parallel**.

### ✅ Custom Actions

* You can define **custom actions** using Lambda or Jenkins integration.

### ✅ Cross-Region and Cross-Account

* You can build **multi-region or multi-account pipelines**.
* Artifacts can be moved across accounts securely using **KMS encryption**.

### ✅ Retry and Timeout

* Each action has **timeout** and **retry logic**.
* Can be configured in the pipeline definition.

---

## 🔷 **Security in CodePipeline**

### 🔐 IAM Roles

* You must create an **IAM service role** for CodePipeline to access other services.

### 🔐 Encryption

* Uses **S3 server-side encryption**.
* Optionally, use **KMS keys** for artifact encryption.

### 🔐 Resource Policies

* To access resources like CodeBuild or CodeDeploy, correct **resource policies** must be configured.

---

## 🔷 **Monitoring & Logging**

* Integrated with **CloudWatch Logs** and **CloudTrail**.
* CodePipeline emits **execution events** to CloudWatch Events.
* Logging includes:

  * Pipeline execution history
  * Stage/action status
  * Error messages (in CloudWatch)

---

## 🔷 **Best Practices**

1. **Use separate pipelines for dev, test, and prod.**
2. **Include manual approval before production deployments.**
3. **Use artifact versioning.**
4. **Enable CloudWatch alarms for failures.**
5. **Use parameters and environment variables.**
6. **Limit IAM permissions with least privilege.**

---

## 🔷 **Common Use Cases**

* Continuous delivery of web applications.
* Automated deployment of infrastructure using CloudFormation.
* CI/CD workflows for containerized applications on ECS/EKS.
* Serverless CI/CD using Lambda and CodeBuild.

---

## 🔷 **Pricing**

* **Free for one active pipeline per month**
* Beyond that, **\$1 per additional active pipeline/month**
* Additional charges for other services used (e.g., CodeBuild minutes, S3 storage, Lambda invocations)
