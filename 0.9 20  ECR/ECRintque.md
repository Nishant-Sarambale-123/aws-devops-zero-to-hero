Here are the **top Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) interview questions** with **detailed answers**, suitable for both beginners and advanced roles in **DevOps**, **Cloud Engineering**, or **AWS-focused positions**.

# ðŸ§  **Amazon ECR Interview Questions & Answers**

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level**

### **1. What is Amazon ECR?**

**Answer:**
Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is a **fully managed Docker-compatible container image registry** by AWS. It allows you to **store, manage, share, and deploy container images** securely and at scale. It integrates tightly with ECS, EKS, Lambda, and CI/CD tools.

---

### **2. How do you push a Docker image to ECR?**

**Answer:**
Steps:

1. Authenticate Docker:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

2. Create a repository:

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-repo
```

3. Tag your image:

```bash
docker tag my-image:latest <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
```

4. Push the image:

```bash
docker push <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
```

### **3. How is ECR different from Docker Hub?**

| Feature      | Amazon ECR                     | Docker Hub              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Integration  | Native AWS integration         | No AWS integration      |
| Security     | IAM-based, encrypted           | Username/password based |
| Availability | Multi-AZ                       | Centralized             |
| Public Repos | Supports both public & private | Supports both           |
| Pricing      | Pay-per-use                    | Free tier + paid plans  |

---

### **4. What is an ECR repository?**

**Answer:**
An **ECR repository** is a **logical container** for storing container images and image versions. You can have **multiple repositories**, each containing one or more versions of an image, identified by **tags**.

---

### **5. What is the format of an ECR image URI?**

**Answer:**

```
<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:<tag>
```

Example:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myapp:latest
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level**

### **6. How do you authenticate Docker to ECR?**

**Answer:**
You use AWS CLI to get a login token:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR registry>
```

This authenticates Docker to push/pull from the ECR registry.

---

### **7. What are lifecycle policies in ECR?**

**Answer:**
Lifecycle policies in ECR allow you to **automatically remove old, unused, or untagged images** from your repository. This helps save storage costs and maintain a clean registry.

Example: Keep only the latest 10 images and delete the rest.

---

### **8. What is the difference between a tag and a digest in ECR?**

| Property | Tag                          | Digest (SHA256 hash)        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Human-readable version label | Unique identifier for image |
| Mutable  | Yes (can overwrite)          | No (immutable)              |
| Format   | `:latest`, `:v1.0`           | `@sha256:abcdef...`         |

---

### **9. How does ECR integrate with ECS and EKS?**

**Answer:**

* **ECS**: Task definitions can reference images hosted in ECR.
* **EKS**: Kubernetes pods can pull ECR images via IAM roles using IRSA (IAM Role for Service Accounts).

---

### **10. What is image scanning in ECR?**

**Answer:**
Amazon ECR provides **vulnerability scanning** of images using **Amazon Inspector**. It scans OS packages and software libraries for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

You can:

* Enable scan on push
* Run on-demand scans

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level**

### **11. How can you share an ECR repository with another AWS account?**

**Answer:**
Use **ECR repository resource policies** to grant access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountPull",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **12. What is ECRâ€™s cross-region replication?**

**Answer:**
ECR supports automatic **replication of images across AWS regions**, which helps:

* Improve availability in multi-region architectures
* Reduce latency
* Prepare for disaster recovery

---

### **13. How do you delete images in ECR?**

**Answer:**
Manually:

```bash
aws ecr batch-delete-image \
  --repository-name my-repo \
  --image-ids imageTag=latest
```

Or automatically with **lifecycle policies**.

---

### **14. Can you restrict image overwrites in ECR?**

**Answer:**
Yes, you can enable **immutable tags** in the repository settings. This prevents pushing an image with an already existing tag.

---

### **15. What are public ECR repositories?**

**Answer:**
AWS provides a **public ECR registry** (like Docker Hub), hosted at:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://gallery.ecr.aws](https://gallery.ecr.aws)

Anyone can:

* Push public images (with limits)
* Pull images without authentication

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Scenario-based/Real-World Questions**

### **16. You need to store 50 image versions but only deploy 5. How do you manage this in ECR?**

**Answer:**
Use **lifecycle policies** to keep the latest 5 image versions (by tag or time) and delete older ones automatically.

---

### **17. Your ECS task fails to pull from ECR. What would you check?**

**Answer:**

* IAM role permissions (`ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`)
* ECR repository URI and region
* Docker authentication
* Network (VPC, NAT Gateway if using private subnets)
* Image tag exists

---

### **18. How do you scan container images for vulnerabilities before deploying to production?**

**Answer:**

* Enable **scan on push** in ECR.
* Or manually run `start-image-scan` using AWS CLI.
* View scan findings in ECR or through Amazon Inspector.

---

### **19. How can you allow an EKS cluster to pull private images from ECR?**

**Answer:**

* Use **IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA)**.
* Attach necessary `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`, etc.
* Kubernetes will assume this role using service account.

---

### **20. What happens if two images have the same tag but different digests?**

**Answer:**
Only the **latest pushed image** with the tag is retained. The digest will differ. If **immutable tags** are enabled, the second push with the same tag will be rejected.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Bonus: Useful CLI Commands**

```bash
# Create repo
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name myrepo

# Push image
docker push <acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/myrepo:latest

# List images
aws ecr list-images --repository-name myrepo

# Start image scan
aws ecr start-image-scan --repository-name myrepo --image-id imageTag=latest
```
