## üîê 1. **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**

### ‚úÖ **Interview Questions**

**Q1: What is AWS KMS?**
**A:**
AWS KMS is a managed service to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt your data across AWS services like S3, EBS, and RDS.

**Q2: What is envelope encryption in AWS KMS?**
**A:**
Envelope encryption uses a master key to encrypt a data key, which is then used to encrypt the actual data. This improves performance and security.

**Q3: How is KMS integrated with CloudTrail?**
**A:**
All usage of KMS keys is logged in CloudTrail, providing an audit trail of who accessed which key and when.
