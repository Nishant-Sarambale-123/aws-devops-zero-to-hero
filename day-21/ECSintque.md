## âœ… **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) - Detailed Notes**

---

### ðŸ”· What is Amazon ECS?

**Amazon ECS** is a **fully managed container orchestration service** that makes it easy to run, scale, and secure Docker containers on AWS infrastructure.

It supports two launch types:

* **EC2 Launch Type**: You manage the EC2 instances (compute infrastructure).
* **Fargate Launch Type**: AWS manages the infrastructure for you (serverless).

### ðŸ”· Key ECS Concepts

| Term                | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Definition** | Blueprint describing your application (image, CPU/memory, ports, environment variables, etc.).        |
| **Task**            | A running container or group of containers defined in the task definition.                            |
| **Service**         | Ensures the specified number of tasks are running and healthy. Supports auto-scaling, load balancing. |
| **Cluster**         | Logical grouping of EC2/Fargate resources to run tasks.                                               |
| **Container Agent** | Runs on EC2 instances to communicate with ECS.                                                        |
| **Launch Type**     | Determines the infrastructure: EC2 (user-managed) or Fargate (AWS-managed).                           |

### ðŸ”· ECS Launch Types

#### âœ… **1. EC2 Launch Type**

* Requires provisioning and managing EC2 instances.
* You install ECS container agent on the instances.
* You choose AMIs, network, scaling, etc.

#### âœ… **2. Fargate Launch Type**

* **Serverless**: No need to manage EC2 instances.
* Define resources (vCPU, memory), and AWS handles provisioning.
* Ideal for microservices and dynamic workloads.

---

### ðŸ”· Task Definition

A **JSON blueprint** for running containers.

Key fields:

* `family`: Name of the task definition
* `containerDefinitions`: List of containers (image, ports, command)
* `cpu` / `memory`: Task-level resource requirements
* `environment`: Env vars for the container
* `logConfiguration`: Logging (e.g., CloudWatch)
* `mountPoints` / `volumes`: For persistent storage

Example:

```json
{
  "family": "webapp-task",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "image": "nginx",
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256,
      "portMappings": [{ "containerPort": 80 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### ðŸ”· ECS Services

* Maintain the desired number of task replicas.
* Auto-restart unhealthy tasks.
* **Optional integration with ALB/NLB** for load balancing.
* Support for **rolling updates** and **blue/green deployments** (with CodeDeploy).

---

### ðŸ”· ECS Cluster

* Logical group of compute resources (EC2 or Fargate).
* Manages task placement and scheduling.
* Cluster auto scaling (via ASG for EC2).

---

### ðŸ”· Networking in ECS

* Integrated with **Amazon VPC**.
* Each task can get its own **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)**.
* You can choose:

  * **Bridge Mode**
  * **Host Mode**
  * **AWSVPC Mode** (recommended)

---

### ðŸ”· ECS Load Balancing

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: For HTTP(S) traffic.
* **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: For TCP/UDP traffic.
* ECS integrates with **Target Groups** for dynamic registration.

---

### ðŸ”· ECS Auto Scaling

* **Service Auto Scaling**: Scale the number of tasks based on CloudWatch metrics.
* **Cluster Auto Scaling** (for EC2): Scale EC2 instances based on pending tasks.

---

### ðŸ”· Monitoring & Logging

* Use **CloudWatch Logs** to collect container logs.
* **CloudWatch Metrics**: CPU, memory, network.
* **CloudTrail**: API calls auditing.

---

### ðŸ”· Security in ECS

* **IAM Roles**:

  * **Task Role**: For containers to access AWS resources.
  * **Execution Role**: For ECS to pull images/secrets from ECR/Secrets Manager.
* **Security Groups** and **NACLs** for networking.
* **Secrets Management**: Integrate with Secrets Manager/SSM.

---

### ðŸ”· Deployment Strategies

* **Rolling Update** (default): Gradually replace tasks.
* **Blue/Green Deployment**: With **AWS CodeDeploy** integration.
* **Canary deployments** via 3rd-party tools.

### ðŸ”· ECS vs EKS vs Fargate

| Feature           | ECS             | EKS                     | Fargate         |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Control Plane     | AWS managed     | AWS managed Kubernetes  | AWS managed     |
| Container Runtime | Docker          | Kubernetes (containerd) | Docker          |
| Simplicity        | Easier          | Complex                 | Easiest         |
| Use Case          | AWS-native apps | Kubernetes workloads    | Serverless apps |

---

### ðŸ”· Pricing

* **ECS itself is free.**
* You pay for:

  * EC2 instances (if using EC2 launch type)
  * Fargate vCPU + memory (if using Fargate)
  * Data transfer, EBS, load balancers, etc.

---

### ðŸ”· Common Use Cases

* Microservices applications
* Batch processing jobs
* API backend
* Event-driven applications (integrate with SQS, SNS)
* CI/CD pipelines
