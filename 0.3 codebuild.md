Here are **detailed notes on AWS CodeBuild**, including every important concept, usage, examples, CLI, pricing, interview questions, and official documentation links.

## 🧠 What is AWS CodeBuild?

**AWS CodeBuild** is a **fully managed build service** in the AWS DevOps toolchain that **compiles source code**, **runs tests**, and **produces artifacts** ready for deployment.

> 🚫 No need to manage your own build servers or scale CI/CD infrastructure — CodeBuild does it automatically.

## ✅ Key Features

| Feature                | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fully managed          | No need to provision, manage, or scale your build servers.       |
| Continuous scaling     | Automatically scales and processes multiple builds in parallel.  |
| Pay-as-you-go          | You pay only for the compute time consumed.                      |
| Custom environments    | Supports Docker images and custom build environments.            |
| Integration with CI/CD | Works with CodePipeline, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, CodeCommit.  |
| Secure                 | IAM-based access, KMS for encryption, VPC support.               |
| Artifact storage       | Artifacts can be stored in Amazon S3, passed to CodeDeploy, etc. |
| Logs                   | Integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Logs for real-time logging.    |

## 🧱 Core Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project**           | The main unit in CodeBuild that defines how to build and where to get source, artifacts, etc. |
| **Buildspec**         | A YAML file that defines the **build commands** and environment variables.                    |
| **Build Environment** | The runtime environment (Docker image) for the build.                                         |
| **Phases**            | `install`, `pre_build`, `build`, `post_build` defined in the buildspec.                       |
| **Artifacts**         | Files that are output after the build, usually stored in S3.                                  |
| **Source Providers**  | CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, S3, GitHub Enterprise, etc.                                    |
| **Reports**           | Test reports like JUnit can be generated and stored.                                          |

## 🧾 Buildspec File Example (`buildspec.yml`)

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 14
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - npm install

  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Pre-build phase...

  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - npm run build

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  base-directory: dist
```

---

## 🔗 CodeBuild Integration with CodePipeline

**Typical pipeline flow:**

```
CodeCommit / GitHub
      ↓
   CodePipeline
      ↓
   CodeBuild (build and test)
      ↓
  CodeDeploy / ECS / Lambda / S3
```

> CodeBuild is usually used in the **Build** stage of AWS CodePipeline.

---

## 🔒 Security Features

* IAM roles for CodeBuild (build project role)
* KMS encryption for artifacts and logs
* VPC support for running builds in private subnets
* Environment variables can be stored securely using **Secrets Manager** or **Parameter Store**

---

## 📦 Artifacts Output

Artifacts are usually output to **S3**. You define which files/folders you want to export in the `buildspec.yml`.

## 🧰 Common AWS CLI Commands

| Action                | CLI Command                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| List projects         | `aws codebuild list-projects`                                      |
| Create project        | `aws codebuild create-project --cli-input-json file://config.json` |
| Start build           | `aws codebuild start-build --project-name my-project`              |
| Get build status      | `aws codebuild batch-get-builds --ids build-id`                    |
| Get logs (CloudWatch) | Use logGroup and logStream from build details                      |
| Delete project        | `aws codebuild delete-project --name my-project`                   |

## 🛠 Build Environments (Docker Images)

* Managed Docker images:

  * `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0` (includes Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, .NET, etc.)
* Custom Docker images from:

  * Amazon ECR
  * DockerHub

---

## 💰 Pricing

You pay for:

* **Compute time** used during the build.
* 3 compute types: `BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`
* Free tier: **100 build minutes per month on the SMALL instance type**

> [See Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/pricing/)

---

## 🔄 Environment Variables

You can define environment variables in:

* Console
* CLI
* `buildspec.yml`
* Secrets Manager (for secure credentials)

```yaml
env:
  variables:
    ENV_NAME: "production"
    REGION: "us-east-1"
```

---

## 🧪 Test Reporting Support

You can configure **test reports** like JUnit XML in CodeBuild, and it will store the reports in a report group.

```yaml
reports:
  report-group-name-or-arn:
    files:
      - '**/test-report.xml'
    file-format: JUNITXML
```

---

## 🔄 Caching in CodeBuild

To speed up builds, CodeBuild supports **caching dependencies**:

* S3 cache
* Local cache (Docker layer cache, custom cache)

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - 'node_modules/**/*'
```

**Answer**: A YAML file in the source code repository that defines the build phases and commands.

---

### 3. ❓ What are the phases in CodeBuild?

**Answer**: `install`, `pre_build`, `build`, `post_build`.
