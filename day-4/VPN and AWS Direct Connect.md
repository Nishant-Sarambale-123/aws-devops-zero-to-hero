# üîê VPN and AWS Direct Connect ‚Äì Detailed Notes

---

## üìå What is AWS VPN?

**AWS VPN (Virtual Private Network)** allows you to securely connect your **on-premises network or user device** to your **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** over an **encrypted IPsec tunnel** via the internet.

### üß± Components of AWS VPN:

1. **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**

   * AWS side of the VPN connection.
   * Attached to your VPC.

2. **Customer Gateway (CGW)**

   * Your on-premises router or firewall device (or software appliance).
   * Must support IPsec.

3. **VPN Connection**

   * Establishes the tunnel between CGW and VGW.
   * Composed of **two tunnels** for high availability.

### üîê VPN Types:

| Type                 | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Site-to-Site VPN** | Connects your on-premises network to AWS VPC |
| **Client VPN**       | Securely connect remote users to AWS VPC     |
| **AWS CloudHub**     | Connect multiple sites via AWS VPN           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How VPN Works in AWS

1. You create a **Customer Gateway (CGW)** with your public IP and routing information.
2. AWS provides a **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** and a **VPN connection**.
3. You configure the IPsec tunnel on your on-premises firewall/router.
4. Once established, **secure communication** is possible over the **internet** between on-prem and AWS VPC.

---

## ‚úÖ VPN Features

* Encrypted IPsec tunnel (AES-256)
* Two tunnels (active/passive) for **redundancy**
* Supports **static or BGP (dynamic) routing**
* Can be combined with **Direct Connect for backup**
* Pay-as-you-go pricing (per hour + data)

---

## üìå What is AWS Direct Connect?

**AWS Direct Connect (DX)** is a **dedicated network connection** between your on-premises data center and AWS.

Instead of routing traffic over the internet (like VPN), Direct Connect uses a **private, physical fiber link** to connect to AWS.

### üß± Components of Direct Connect:

1. **Direct Connect Location**

   * A co-location facility where AWS has a presence.

2. **Cross Connect**

   * Your router connects to the AWS router using Ethernet.

3. **Virtual Interfaces (VIFs)**

   * Used to separate traffic:

     * **Private VIF**: Connects to VPC
     * **Public VIF**: Connects to AWS public services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB)

4. **Router Configuration**

   * You use **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** for routing.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Direct Connect Works

1. You order a **dedicated fiber link** to an AWS Direct Connect location.
2. AWS provisions a port on their router.
3. You set up a **private virtual interface (VIF)** to connect to your VPC.
4. Traffic flows **privately** and **securely** with **low latency**.

---

## ‚úÖ Direct Connect Features

* **Dedicated fiber** ‚Äî up to 10 Gbps or more
* Lower latency than VPN
* Consistent performance (unlike internet-based VPN)
* Can be combined with VPN for **redundancy**
* Reduced **data transfer costs** (50‚Äì70% savings)

## üÜö VPN vs Direct Connect ‚Äì Comparison Table

| Feature    | AWS VPN                            | AWS Direct Connect                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Medium     | Internet (IPsec)                   | Dedicated fiber link                     |
| Security   | Encrypted (IPsec)                  | Private circuit (can add IPsec manually) |
| Latency    | Higher (varies with internet)      | Lower (consistent)                       |
| Bandwidth  | Limited (up to \~1.25 Gbps/tunnel) | High (1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps)         |
| Use Case   | Quick, low-cost setup              | High-performance enterprise connection   |
| Setup Time | Minutes to hours                   | Days to weeks                            |
| Cost       | Low                                | High (but saves on data transfer)        |
| Redundancy | Two tunnels                        | Can be combined with VPN                 |
