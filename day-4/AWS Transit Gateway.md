# 🟦 AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) – Detailed Notes

---

## 📌 What is AWS Transit Gateway?

**AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** is a **network transit hub** that connects **multiple VPCs and on-premises networks** via a **single gateway**.

Instead of creating **point-to-point peering** connections between every VPC, you can use a **hub-and-spoke model** with Transit Gateway, which greatly simplifies and centralizes network architecture.

> 🧠 Think of it as a cloud **router** that scales with your network and supports **transitive routing**.

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

* Centralized and **simplified connectivity** for hundreds of VPCs
* **Transitive routing** is supported (unlike VPC peering)
* Connect **on-premises networks**, **VPN**, and **Direct Connect**
* Scales to thousands of connections
* Enhanced **security**, **segmentation**, and **control**
* **Inter-region** and **multi-account** support

| **Propagation**             | Adds routes from attachments into TGW route tables automatically |
| **Association**             | Connects attachments to a TGW route table                        |
| **Transit Gateway Connect** | Extend TGW to third-party appliances (e.g., SD-WAN)              |

## 🔁 Attachments in TGW

| Type                   | Use                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **VPC Attachment**     | Connects a VPC to TGW                         |
| **VPN Attachment**     | Connects an AWS VPN to TGW                    |
| **Direct Connect**     | Connects DX Gateway to TGW                    |
| **Peering Attachment** | Connects TGWs in different regions            |
| **Connect Attachment** | Extends TGW to SD-WAN or third-party networks |

---

## 📤 Route Tables in TGW

* TGW supports **multiple route tables**.
* Each attachment (VPC, VPN) can be **associated** with **one TGW route table**.
* You can **propagate** routes from any attachment to any TGW route table.
* Allows **segmentation** of traffic (e.g., dev vs prod environments).

---

## 🛠️ Example Use Cases

1. **Multi-VPC network** for large enterprise or SaaS provider
2. **Centralized egress control** (traffic to internet/NAT goes through a shared VPC)
3. **Hybrid connectivity** (on-prem to AWS via VPN/DX + multiple VPCs)
4. **Shared Services VPC** (DNS, AD, etc.) used by many other VPCs
5. **Regional interconnectivity** using **TGW peering**

---

## 🔒 Security Features

* **IAM policies** for controlling access
* Can **segment traffic** using multiple route tables
* Integrates with **AWS Network Firewall**, **Firewall Manager**, etc.
* **No transitive peering** across TGWs unless explicitly configured

## 🆚 TGW vs VPC Peering

| Feature       | Transit Gateway     | VPC Peering                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Routing       | Transitive          | Non-transitive                               |
| Scale         | Thousands of VPCs   | 125 peering connections per VPC (soft limit) |
| Route Tables  | Centralized         | Per VPC                                      |
| Cross-Region  | Supported           | Supported                                    |
| Inter-Account | Supported           | Supported                                    |
| Simplicity    | Centralized, easier | Complex in large networks                    |

## 💵 Pricing Overview

* Charged per **attachment-hour**
* **Data processing charge** per GB (e.g., \$0.02/GB)
* Additional charges for **inter-region peering**

> **Note**: VPC peering is cheaper for small, static environments; TGW is more cost-effective for large-scale architectures.
