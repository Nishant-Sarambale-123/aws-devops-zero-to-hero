# üß† AWS VPC Interview Questions & Answers (Detailed)

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **What is a VPC in AWS?**

**Answer:**
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a **logically isolated network** within the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources. You define your own **IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways**, and **firewalls** to control traffic in and out.

**Key Points:**

* Customizable IP range using **CIDR**
* Full control over network configuration
* Can create **public, private, or hybrid** networks
* Supports VPN and Direct Connect for on-prem integration

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **What is the difference between public and private subnets in a VPC?**

**Answer:**

| Feature              | Public Subnet              | Private Subnet               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Internet Access      | Yes (via Internet Gateway) | No direct access             |
| NAT Gateway Required | ‚ùå                          | ‚úÖ (for outbound internet)    |
| Common Use           | Web servers                | Databases, internal services |

* A subnet is **public** if its route table has a route to an **Internet Gateway**.
* A **private subnet** has **no such route**, isolating it from direct internet exposure.

### ‚úÖ 3. **What is the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs?**

| Feature         | Security Groups     | Network ACLs                    |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Level           | Instance level      | Subnet level                    |
| Type            | Stateful            | Stateless                       |
| Rules           | Allow only          | Allow/Deny                      |
| Rule Evaluation | All rules evaluated | Rules evaluated in number order |

* **Security Group** maintains connection state (return traffic automatically allowed).
* **NACL** does **not remember state** and needs explicit inbound/outbound rules.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)?**

**Answer:**
An IGW is a **highly available VPC component** that enables instances in a **public subnet** to connect to the **internet**.

**Important:**

* Must be **attached to a VPC**
* Requires **route table entries** to allow 0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW
* Public instances need **Elastic IP or public IP**

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **What is a NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance?**

| Feature           | NAT Gateway          | NAT Instance               |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type              | Managed service      | EC2 instance               |
| High Availability | Built-in             | Must be configured         |
| Performance       | Scales automatically | Manual scaling             |
| Maintenance       | No admin             | Needs patching, monitoring |

**Use Case**: Allow **private subnet instances** to **initiate outbound connections** (like updates) but **block inbound connections** from the internet.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **What is VPC Peering?**

**Answer:**
VPC Peering allows **private communication between two VPCs** using **private IPs**, **without going through the internet**.

**Key Notes:**

* Can be **in same or different AWS accounts**
* **Transitive peering not supported**
* Must update **route tables** on both sides

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **What is AWS Transit Gateway? How is it better than VPC Peering?**

**Answer:**
Transit Gateway (TGW) is a **centralized hub** that connects **multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect** links.

**Why better:**

* Supports **transitive routing**
* Scales to **thousands of VPCs**
* **Simplifies** network management (hub-and-spoke model)

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **What are VPC Endpoints? Types?**

**Answer:**
VPC Endpoints allow **private communication between VPC and AWS services** without needing Internet Gateway or NAT.

**Types:**

1. **Interface Endpoint** ‚Äì ENI-based, used for services like S3, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager
2. **Gateway Endpoint** ‚Äì Route-table-based, available only for S3 and DynamoDB

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **How does routing work in a VPC?**

**Answer:**
Each subnet is associated with a **Route Table** which determines where the traffic goes.

Example:

* Route `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`: Internet access
* Route `10.0.2.0/24 ‚Üí peering`: VPC Peering
* Route `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`: private subnet internet access

---

### ‚úÖ 10. **What is VPC Flow Logs?**

**Answer:**
VPC Flow Logs allow you to **capture and monitor network traffic** for your VPC.

**Use Cases:**

* Troubleshooting
* Auditing
* Security analysis
* Stored in **CloudWatch** or **S3**

---

### ‚úÖ 11. **What is a Virtual Private Gateway and Customer Gateway in VPN setup?**

**Answer:**

* **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**: AWS side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection
* **Customer Gateway (CGW)**: On-premises router/firewall
* Used in **hybrid cloud** setups to connect on-prem data center with AWS VPC

---

### ‚úÖ 12. **What is a default VPC?**

**Answer:**

* Automatically created per AWS region
* Comes with one subnet per AZ
* **Has IGW, route table, NACLs, and security group** pre-configured
* Ideal for quick testing/development

---

### ‚úÖ 13. **Can you have overlapping CIDR blocks between two VPCs?**

**Answer:**

* No. For VPC Peering or Transit Gateway to work, **CIDR blocks must not overlap.**
* Overlapping IPs cause **routing conflicts** and failures.

---

### ‚úÖ 14. **How can you achieve High Availability in a VPC?**

**Answer:**

* Create **multiple subnets across Availability Zones**
* Use **NAT Gateways in each AZ**
* Distribute applications across **public and private subnets**
* Use **multi-AZ RDS**, **Elastic Load Balancer**, and **Auto Scaling**

---

### ‚úÖ 15. **How do Security Groups and NACLs work together?**

**Answer:**
Traffic must **pass both Security Group and NACL rules**:

* NACL applies at **subnet level first**
* Security Group applies at **EC2 level**
* So even if SG allows it, NACL must also allow it

## üîó Bonus: Real-World Scenario-Based Questions

### üß† Q: You have 3 VPCs: A, B, and C. A is peered with B, and B is peered with C. Can A talk to C?

* **A:** No. VPC peering is **non-transitive**.

### üß† Q: Your database is in a private subnet and needs to download security updates. How will you do it?

* **A:** Use a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet and route private subnet traffic through it.
