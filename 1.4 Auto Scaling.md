Got it 👍 Let’s build a **detailed set of notes on Auto Scaling (AWS Auto Scaling + EC2 Auto Scaling)** along with **commonly asked interview questions and answers**.

# 📘 Detailed Notes on Auto Scaling (AWS)

## 1. What is Auto Scaling?

* **Auto Scaling** in AWS automatically adjusts the number of compute resources (EC2, ECS tasks, DynamoDB capacity, etc.) based on demand.
* Helps achieve:

  * **High availability** (maintains minimum required resources).
  * **Cost optimization** (removes unused capacity).
  * **Scalability** (meets traffic spikes).

---

## 2. Components of Auto Scaling

### a) **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

* Logical grouping of EC2 instances.
* Defines:

  * **Min Size** → Minimum number of instances running at all times.
  * **Max Size** → Maximum number of instances allowed.
  * **Desired Capacity** → Number of instances ASG tries to maintain.
* Instances can span across **multiple AZs** for HA.

### b) **Launch Template / Launch Configuration**

* Blueprint for launching instances.
* Contains:

  * AMI ID
  * Instance type
  * Security groups
  * Key pairs
  * Storage configuration

> **Note:** Launch Templates are preferred over Launch Configurations (they support versioning, mixed instances, etc.).

### c) **Scaling Policies**

* Define when and how ASG should scale.
* Types:

  1. **Target Tracking** → Keeps a metric at a set value (e.g., maintain CPU at 50%).
  2. **Step Scaling** → Scale by steps based on alarms (e.g., +2 instances if CPU > 70%).
  3. **Simple Scaling** → Add/remove instances when a CloudWatch alarm triggers.
  4. **Scheduled Scaling** → Predefined scale actions (e.g., scale out every morning 9 AM).

### d) **Health Checks**

* Ensures only healthy instances serve traffic.
* Types:

  * **EC2 Status Check**
  * **ELB Health Check** (if attached to load balancer)
* Unhealthy instances are automatically replaced.

### e) **Lifecycle Hooks**

* Lets you perform custom actions when instances launch/terminate.

  * Example: Run configuration scripts, register with monitoring, wait for approvals.

## 3. How Auto Scaling Works

1. CloudWatch monitors metrics (CPU, Memory, Requests).
2. Alarms trigger scaling policies.
3. ASG launches/terminates EC2 instances based on:

   * Scaling policies
   * Desired capacity
   * Min/Max size
4. ELB automatically balances traffic across healthy instances.

---

## 4. Benefits of Auto Scaling

* **Elasticity**: Scales up/down automatically.
* **High Availability**: Replaces unhealthy instances.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Only pay for what you use.
* **Resilience**: Distributes across multiple AZs.

---

## 5. Advanced Features

* **Predictive Scaling**: Uses ML to forecast demand and scale proactively.
* **Warm Pools**: Keep pre-initialized instances ready for faster scale-out.
* **Instance Refresh**: Rolling updates of ASG instances with new configuration.

# 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers on Auto Scaling

### 1. What is Auto Scaling in AWS?

**Answer:**
Auto Scaling is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances or other resources based on traffic load, ensuring applications are highly available and cost-effective.

---

### 2. Difference between AWS Auto Scaling and EC2 Auto Scaling?

**Answer:**

* **EC2 Auto Scaling** → Scales only EC2 instances.
* **AWS Auto Scaling** → Unified service that can scale multiple AWS services (EC2, DynamoDB, ECS, Aurora).

---

### 3. What are scaling policies in Auto Scaling?

**Answer:**
Scaling policies define when and how Auto Scaling adjusts capacity:

* **Target Tracking** (maintains a metric at a target level).
* **Step Scaling** (scale gradually).
* **Simple Scaling** (basic, alarm-based).
* **Scheduled Scaling** (time-based).

---

### 4. How does Auto Scaling ensure high availability?

**Answer:**

* By distributing instances across multiple AZs.
* By replacing unhealthy instances automatically.
* By maintaining a minimum number of instances.

---

### 5. What are lifecycle hooks in Auto Scaling?

**Answer:**
Lifecycle hooks allow custom actions during instance launch/terminate events.
Example: Run user-data scripts, configure monitoring, or delay termination until cleanup completes.

---

### 6. How is Auto Scaling integrated with Load Balancer?

**Answer:**

* ASG can register instances with **ALB, NLB, or CLB**.
* ELB distributes traffic to healthy instances.
* Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances and updates ELB.

---

### 7. What’s the difference between predictive scaling and dynamic scaling?

**Answer:**

* **Predictive Scaling**: Uses ML to forecast demand and scale proactively.
* **Dynamic Scaling**: Reacts in real-time to CloudWatch alarms.

---

### 8. Can Auto Scaling scale to zero?

**Answer:**

* **EC2 Auto Scaling**: Min size must be ≥ 1 (cannot scale to 0).
* **Other services (like ECS, Lambda provisioned concurrency, DynamoDB)**: Can scale to zero.

---

### 9. How do you configure Auto Scaling for cost optimization?

**Answer:**

* Use **Spot + On-Demand mix** with ASG.
* Use **target tracking scaling** to avoid overprovisioning.
* Set proper **min/max/desired capacity**.

---

### 10. Real-world scenario question:

> **Q:** Your application faces heavy load during business hours and is idle at night. How would you configure Auto Scaling?
> **Answer:**

* Use **scheduled scaling**: Scale out at 9 AM and scale in at 7 PM.
* Combine with **target tracking** to handle unexpected spikes.
* Distribute across multiple AZs for HA.
