Here are **detailed notes on AWS CodeCommit**, including all important concepts, use cases, architecture, commands, integrations, interview questions, and official links.

## 🧠 **What is AWS CodeCommit?**

**AWS CodeCommit** is a **fully managed source control service** that hosts **private Git repositories**. It eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling infrastructure.

## ✅ **Key Features**

| Feature           | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fully managed     | No need to manage infrastructure.                                  |
| High availability | Data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs in AWS.       |
| Scalable          | Automatically scales to meet growing repository needs.             |
| Secure            | Integrated with IAM; supports encryption at rest and in transit.   |
| Git-Compatible    | Works with existing Git tools.                                     |
| Access Control    | IAM-based access policies, Git credentials, SSH keys, etc.         |
| Triggers          | Supports triggering AWS Lambda, SNS, or SQS on events like pushes. |
| Integration       | Easily integrates with AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Jenkins, etc.  |

---

## 🧱 **Core Components**

| Component         | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository**    | A Git-based project folder hosted in CodeCommit.         |
| **Branch**        | Feature branches just like in Git (e.g., `main`, `dev`). |
| **Commits**       | Git commits are pushed just like in GitHub or GitLab.    |
| **Pull Requests** | Can be used for code reviews and merging changes.        |
| **Triggers**      | Can invoke Lambda, SNS, or SQS when changes happen.      |

---

## 🛡️ **Authentication Methods**

1. **HTTPS (with Git credentials)**
2. **SSH (with uploaded public keys)**
3. **AWS CLI or SDK (programmatic access via IAM roles/users)**

---

## 🔐 **Access Control (IAM Integration)**

* Permissions are controlled via **IAM policies**.
* Example: Allow user to push to a specific repository:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "codecommit:GitPush",
      "codecommit:GetRepository"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:region:account-id:repo-name"
  }]
}
```

---

## 🔁 **Triggers & Notifications**

* Supported targets:

  * **Lambda functions** (e.g., for custom CI/CD workflows)
  * **SNS topics** (e.g., send email/slack alert)
  * **SQS queues** (e.g., decouple event processing)
* Supported events:

  * `push`, `pullRequestCreated`, `pullRequestMerged`, etc.

---

## 🔧 **Integration with CI/CD**

### 💡 CodeCommit → CodePipeline

1. **CodeCommit** (source)
2. **CodeBuild** (build)
3. **CodeDeploy** (deployment)
4. **CloudWatch Logs** (monitoring)

> You can define CodePipeline using **console** or **CloudFormation**.

## ⚙️ **Common AWS CLI Commands**

| Task                           | Command Example                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create repository              | `aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name MyRepo`                  |
| List repositories              | `aws codecommit list-repositories`                                           |
| Clone repo                     | `git clone https://git-codecommit.region.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyRepo`      |
| Create pull request            | `aws codecommit create-pull-request --title "MyPR" --description "desc" ...` |
| Add SSH public key to IAM user | `aws iam upload-ssh-public-key ...`                                          |
| List branches                  | `aws codecommit list-branches --repository-name MyRepo`                      |

---

## 🧪 **Best Practices**

* Enable **encryption** (KMS is default).
* Use **branch protection rules** (using IAM).
* Enable **notifications** on key events (e.g., PR merged).
* Automate workflows via **Lambda triggers**.
* Integrate with **CodePipeline** for CI/CD.
* Use **tags** to organize and manage repositories.
