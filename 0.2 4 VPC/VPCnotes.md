# 🟦 Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) – Detailed Notes

---

## 📌 **What is Amazon VPC?**

Amazon VPC is a logically isolated **virtual network** within AWS where you can **launch AWS resources** (like EC2 instances) in a customizable, private network.

It resembles a **traditional data center network** and allows complete control over:

* IP address ranges
* Subnet creation
* Routing tables
* Internet gateways
* Security

---

## ✅ **Key Benefits of VPC**

* Full control over your **networking environment**
* Isolated & secure by design
* **Scalable** (can add more subnets, instances)
* Integrates with **AWS services** (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.)
* Supports **hybrid connections** (VPN, Direct Connect)

---

## 🧱 **VPC Core Components**

| Component                  | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIDR Block**             | IP range for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)             |
| **Subnets**                | Divide VPC into smaller IP blocks (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24) |
| **Route Tables**           | Control traffic flow between subnets or outside       |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Enables internet access                               |
| **NAT Gateway / Instance** | Allows private subnets to access the internet         |
| **Elastic IP**             | Static IP assigned to resources                       |
| **Network ACL (NACL)**     | Stateless firewall at subnet level                    |
| **Security Groups**        | Stateful firewall at instance level                   |
| **DHCP Options Set**       | Custom DNS, domain name, NTP                          |
| **VPC Peering**            | Connects two VPCs privately                           |
| **Endpoints**              | Private access to AWS services without Internet       |
| **VPC Flow Logs**          | Log network traffic going in/out of interfaces        |

---

## 📌 **CIDR Block**

* When you create a VPC, you assign a **CIDR block** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
* **Private IP Ranges supported:**

  * 10.0.0.0/8
  * 172.16.0.0/12
  * 192.168.0.0/16
* Max VPC size: **/16** (i.e., 65,536 IPs)

---

## 📂 **Subnets**

* Subnets divide a VPC's CIDR into smaller chunks.
* **Public Subnet**: Has a route to Internet Gateway.
* **Private Subnet**: No route to Internet Gateway.
* Subnet must be within the VPC’s CIDR block.
* Each subnet resides in **one Availability Zone (AZ)** only.

---

## 🌍 **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* **Allows communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet**
* Must attach IGW to the VPC.
* Route table must explicitly allow **0.0.0.0/0 → IGW**

---

## 🔁 **Route Tables**

* Each subnet must be associated with a **route table**.
* Routes determine where traffic is directed.
* Default route table (main) is automatically created.
* Custom route tables can be made and associated with subnets.

---

## 🔐 **Security Groups vs NACLs**

| Feature    | Security Group                       | NACL                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Type       | Stateful                             | Stateless                  |
| Applied to | EC2 instance                         | Subnet                     |
| Rules      | Allow only                           | Allow/Deny                 |
| Direction  | Inbound + Outbound                   | Inbound + Outbound         |
| Default    | Deny all inbound, allow all outbound | Allow all inbound/outbound |

---

## 📤 **NAT Gateway / NAT Instance**

* **Use case**: When instances in private subnets need internet access.
* **NAT Gateway**: Fully managed, highly available, scales automatically.
* **NAT Instance**: Self-managed EC2 instance configured for NAT (legacy).
* **Must be in a public subnet** and route private subnet traffic to it.

---

## 🛡️ **VPC Endpoints**

Allows **private connection** to AWS services **without going through Internet**.

1. **Interface Endpoint**: ENI used for services like S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway.
2. **Gateway Endpoint**: Route table entry for S3/DynamoDB.

---

## 🔗 **VPC Peering**

* Connect two VPCs for **private traffic** flow.
* Must update route tables in both VPCs.
* **Peering is not transitive**.
* Can be across accounts and regions (inter-region peering).

---

## 🌐 **Transit Gateway**

* A central hub to connect **multiple VPCs and on-premises** networks.
* Scales better than VPC peering.
* Supports **transitive routing**.

---

## 🔌 **VPN and Direct Connect**

* **VPN**: IPSec tunnel from on-premises to VPC.
* **Direct Connect**: Dedicated fiber link for **low-latency, high-bandwidth** access.

---

## 📄 **VPC Flow Logs**

* Capture IP traffic going to/from **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)**.
* Useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, security audits.
* Logs stored in **CloudWatch Logs** or **S3**.

---

## 🧰 **VPC Features & Tools**

* **Elastic IPs**: Static public IPs assigned to AWS resources.
* **DHCP Options Set**: Customize DNS/NTP servers in the VPC.
* **PrivateLink**: Securely access services hosted in another VPC.

---

## 🏗️ **Default VPC vs Custom VPC**

| Feature                   | Default VPC      | Custom VPC                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Automatically created     | Yes              | No                            |
| Default route to internet | Yes              | Only if IGW added             |
| Subnets                   | One per AZ       | Manual                        |
| Use case                  | Quick EC2 launch | Production-grade architecture |

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Common Use Cases**

* Web + App tier separation using public/private subnets
* Hybrid cloud with VPN or Direct Connect
* Isolated environments (e.g., dev, test, prod)
* Microservices or multi-tiered architecture
