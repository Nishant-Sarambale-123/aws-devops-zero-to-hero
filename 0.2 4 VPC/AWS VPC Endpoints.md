# üîí AWS VPC Endpoints ‚Äì Full Detailed Notes

---

## üîπ What is a VPC Endpoint?

A **VPC Endpoint** allows you to **privately connect** your VPC to supported AWS services **without using the internet, NAT Gateway, VPN, or Direct Connect**.

‚û°Ô∏è Traffic **never leaves the AWS network** ‚Üí More secure and lower latency.

---

## üîπ Why Use VPC Endpoints?

* **Enhanced security**: No traffic over public internet.
* **Avoid NAT Gateway costs** for private subnet access.
* **Better performance**: Uses AWS backbone.
* **Simplifies architecture** for private workloads needing AWS services.

---

## üîπ Two Types of VPC Endpoints

| Type                   | Description                                      | Used For                                           | Behind the scenes           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Gateway Endpoint**   | A target in the route table that directs traffic | **S3, DynamoDB** only                              | Adds a route in route table |
| **Interface Endpoint** | Elastic network interface (ENI) in your subnet   | Most **AWS services** (SNS, SSM, CloudWatch, etc.) | Deploys ENI with private IP |

---

## üîπ 1. Gateway Endpoint (For S3 and DynamoDB Only)

* Adds a **route** to the service via endpoint in your **route table**
* **Highly available and free**
* Works with:

  * **Amazon S3**
  * **Amazon DynamoDB**

### üîß Setup:

* Create gateway endpoint.
* Choose VPC and route table.
* Select S3/DynamoDB.
* Add policy to control access.

### üìù Example Policy:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üîπ 2. Interface Endpoint (Powered by PrivateLink)

* **ENI with private IPs** in your subnet.
* Connects to many AWS services and **SaaS solutions**.
* Can be used with:

  * EC2, ECS, SSM, Secrets Manager, KMS, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch, etc.
* Supports **Private DNS** for using regular AWS service names (like `ssm.amazonaws.com`).

### üîß Setup:

* Create interface endpoint.
* Select service and VPC.
* Choose subnet and security group.
* (Optional) Enable **Private DNS**.

## üîπ Supported Services

| Type          | Services                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway**   | S3, DynamoDB                                                         |
| **Interface** | Nearly all others (SSM, EC2, KMS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, etc.) |

Use the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/aws-services-privatelink-support.html) to view full list of supported services.

## üîπ VPC Endpoint vs NAT Gateway

| Feature     | VPC Endpoint                            | NAT Gateway                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Path        | AWS private network                     | Public internet                     |
| Cost        | Interface: hourly + data; Gateway: free | Per GB + hourly charge              |
| Security    | Highly secure (no internet)             | Less secure (uses internet)         |
| Performance | Better (internal)                       | Good, but over public routes        |
| Use Case    | Access AWS services privately           | Internet access from private subnet |

---

## üîπ Interview Tip ‚Äì VPC Endpoint Use Case

**Q: How would you let EC2 in private subnet access S3 without using a NAT Gateway?**

‚úÖ **Answer**:

* Use a **Gateway VPC Endpoint** for S3.
* Add a route in the route table of the private subnet.
* Ensure proper IAM and endpoint policies.

---

## üîπ Pricing

* **Gateway Endpoint**: Free
* **Interface Endpoint**:

  * Charged **per hour per AZ**
  * **Data processing charges** per GB (in and out)

---

## üîπ Limitations

| Limitation                                     | Details                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not all services support Gateway Endpoint      | Only **S3 and DynamoDB**                                |
| Interface Endpoint per AZ                      | Must deploy in each AZ separately                       |
| PrivateLink doesn't support transitive routing | VPC peering or Transit Gateway needed for cross-VPC use |
| Not for third-party APIs                       | Only supports AWS & certain SaaS vendors                |

---

## üîπ Security Considerations

* Use **endpoint policies** to restrict access to specific buckets/tables/resources.
* Use **security groups** for interface endpoints.
* Monitor traffic with **VPC Flow Logs**.

---

## üîπ Terraform Example ‚Äì Interface Endpoint

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc_endpoint" "ssm" {
  vpc_id       = aws_vpc.main.id
  service_name = "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ssm"
  vpc_endpoint_type = "Interface"
  subnet_ids   = [aws_subnet.private.id]
  security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.sg.id]
  private_dns_enabled = true
}
```

---

## üîπ Real-World Example

You have an **EC2 in a private subnet** that needs to:

* Store logs to **S3**
* Use **SSM agent** for patching
* Fetch secrets from **Secrets Manager**

You‚Äôll need:

* **Gateway Endpoint** for S3
* **Interface Endpoints** for:

  * `com.amazonaws.region.ssm`
  * `com.amazonaws.region.secretsmanager`
