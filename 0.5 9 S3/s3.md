---

## ðŸ”¹ **What is Amazon S3?**

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an object storage service that offers **industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.**

You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve **any amount of data** at **any time**, from anywhere on the web.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Core Concepts in Amazon S3**

| Term         | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**   | A container for storing objects in S3. Every object is stored in a bucket.                   |
| **Object**   | Fundamental unit of storage in S3. Composed of data + metadata + unique key.                 |
| **Key**      | Unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Like a file path.                           |
| **Region**   | Physical location where the data is stored. Choose regions close to users to reduce latency. |
| **Prefix**   | Like a folder path. Helps organize and filter data.                                          |
| **Metadata** | Additional information about an object (e.g., Content-Type, custom tags).                    |

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Storage Classes**

S3 offers different **storage classes** based on cost, access frequency, and use cases:

| Storage Class                          | Description                                   | Use Case                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**                        | Default, high durability & availability.      | Frequently accessed data.                |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**             | Automatically moves objects between tiers.    | Unknown or changing access patterns.     |
| **S3 Standard-IA**                     | Infrequent Access, lower cost, retrieval fee. | Backups, disaster recovery.              |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                     | Stored in single AZ, cheaper.                 | Re-creatable data, not mission-critical. |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**       | Low-cost, milliseconds retrieval.             | Rarely accessed, quick restore needed.   |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**      | Minutes to hours retrieval.                   | Archival, long-term backups.             |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**            | Cheapest, 12â€“48 hours retrieval.              | Compliance, archival, long-term storage. |
| **S3 Reduced Redundancy (deprecated)** | Lower durability (99.99%). Not recommended.   | Deprecated.                              |

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Durability and Availability**

* **Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
* **Availability**: 99.99% for S3 Standard
* Data is automatically replicated across **multiple AZs**.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Bucket Naming Rules**

* Must be globally unique.
* 3â€“63 characters.
* Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens.
* No uppercase or underscores.
* Should not resemble IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4).

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Data Consistency**

As of Dec 2020, S3 provides:

* **Strong read-after-write consistency** for all objects in all regions.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Object Lifecycle Management**

**Lifecycle policies** automatically transition or delete objects based on defined rules.

Examples:

* Transition to Glacier after 30 days.
* Delete after 365 days.
* Remove incomplete multipart uploads.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Object Versioning**

* Allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object.
* Protects against accidental deletion or overwrite.
* Must be **explicitly enabled** on the bucket.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Encryption Options**

### 1. **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**

| Type        | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SSE-S3**  | Managed by AWS, 256-bit AES encryption.                |
| **SSE-KMS** | Uses AWS Key Management Service, allows audit control. |
| **SSE-C**   | Customer provides own encryption key.                  |

### 2. **Client-Side Encryption**

* Data is encrypted before sending to S3.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Access Control**

### 1. **IAM Policies**

* Attached to users, roles, or groups.
* Grant permissions to perform actions on S3 resources.

### 2. **Bucket Policies**

* JSON policies attached directly to a bucket.
* Control access at the bucket level.

### 3. **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**

* Legacy method.
* Controls access at individual object or bucket level.

### 4. **Block Public Access**

* Prevents accidental exposure of data.
* Can be applied at account or bucket level.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Presigned URLs**

* Temporarily allow access to private objects via a URL.
* Expiration time can be defined.
* Useful for secure, time-bound sharing.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Event Notifications**

* Trigger events (PUT, DELETE, etc.)
* Can send notifications to:

  * **SNS topic**
  * **SQS queue**
  * **AWS Lambda**

Use case: Automatically process images when uploaded.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Multipart Upload**

* Upload large objects in parts (minimum part size: 5MB except last part).
* Parallel uploads possible.
* Resumable and efficient.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Select**

* Retrieve **subset of data** using SQL-like syntax.
* Useful for CSV, JSON, Parquet files.
* Saves cost by avoiding downloading full files.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Access Points**

* Create custom access configurations per application or VPC.
* Each access point has a unique DNS name.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Object Lock**

* Prevent object deletion for a specified time or indefinitely.
* Compliance & Governance mode.
* Helps meet regulatory requirements.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Replication in S3**

### 1. **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**

* Replicate objects from one region to another.
* Used for disaster recovery, latency reduction.

### 2. **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**

* Replicate within same region.
* Used for data segregation, logging.

> **Note:** Requires versioning to be enabled.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Requester Pays Buckets**

* Enables the bucket owner to charge **data download costs** to the requester.
* Useful for public datasets.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Storage Lens**

* Provides **organization-wide visibility** into object storage usage and activity.
* Dashboards, usage trends, and cost optimization suggestions.

---

## ðŸ”¸ **Monitoring and Logging**

| Feature                   | Purpose                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Server Access Logs** | Logs every request made to the bucket.              |
| **CloudTrail**            | Tracks S3 API calls (who accessed what and when).   |
| **CloudWatch Metrics**    | Basic monitoring for buckets (e.g., # of requests). |
| **AWS Config**            | Tracks configuration changes on S3 resources.       |

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Cost Factors**

* **Storage used (GB)**
* **Number of requests** (GET, PUT, DELETE)
* **Data transfer (outbound only)**
* **Lifecycle transitions**
* **Replication traffic**

---

## ðŸ”¸ **S3 Limits (Soft + Hard)**

| Resource               | Default Limit        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Buckets per account    | 100 (soft limit)     |
| Object size            | 0B to 5TB            |
| PUT upload limit       | 5GB (for single PUT) |
| Multipart minimum part | 5MB                  |
