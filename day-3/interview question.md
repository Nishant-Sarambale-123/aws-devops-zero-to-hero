---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Intermediate EC2 Questions**

### 6. **What is a security group in EC2?**

* **Ans:** Virtual firewall attached to EC2 instances.

  * **Inbound/outbound rules**
  * **Stateful**
  * **Default deny all**

---

### 7. **What is the difference between a security group and a network ACL?**

| Feature    | Security Group | NACL         |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Type       | Instance-level | Subnet-level |
| Rules      | Allow only     | Allow/deny   |
| Stateful   | Yes            | No           |
| Applied To | EC2            | Subnets      |

---

### 8. **What is a key pair in EC2?**

* **Ans:** A public-private key used to SSH into Linux EC2 instances.
* AWS stores the **public key**, user keeps **private key (.pem/.ppk)**.

---

### 9. **What are EC2 instance states?**

* Pending ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Stopping ‚Üí Stopped ‚Üí Terminated

---

### 10. **How do you connect to an EC2 Linux instance?**

* SSH using:

  ```bash
  ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip>
  ```

---

### 11. **What is an Elastic IP?**

* Static public IPv4 address assigned to an EC2.
* Stays the same across stop/start.

---

### 12. **How do you resize an EC2 instance?**

* Stop the instance ‚Üí Change instance type ‚Üí Start again

---

### 13. **How can you protect data in EC2?**

* **Use encrypted EBS volumes**
* **Enable SSL/TLS for apps**
* **Use IAM roles**
* **Restrict access via security groups**

---

### 14. **How to automate EC2 provisioning?**

* Use **Launch Templates**, **Auto Scaling Groups**, **CloudFormation**, or **Terraform**.

---

## üöÄ **Advanced EC2 Interview Questions**

### 15. **What is the difference between a Launch Template and Launch Configuration?**

| Feature            | Launch Template | Launch Configuration |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Versioning         | Yes             | No                   |
| Newer AWS services | Supported       | Limited              |
| Flexibility        | More flexible   | Less flexible        |

---

### 16. **What is EC2 Auto Scaling?**

* Automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on:

  * **CPU Utilization**
  * **Custom CloudWatch metrics**
  * **Schedules**

---

### 17. **What is an EC2 placement group?**

* Logical group of instances for workload placement.

  * **Cluster:** Same AZ ‚Äì low latency
  * **Spread:** Different hardware ‚Äì high availability
  * **Partition:** Logical groups, used for Hadoop, etc.

---

### 18. **How does Spot Instance interruption work?**

* AWS can reclaim spot instances with **2-minute warning**.
* Use **Spot Instance interruption notice** to gracefully shut down.

---

### 19. **What is hibernation in EC2?**

* Pauses an instance and saves RAM contents to EBS.
* Fast boot-up, useful for dev environments.

---

### 20. **What is EC2 user data?**

* Script executed at instance launch.
* Example: Installing Apache

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  yum update -y
  yum install httpd -y
  systemctl start httpd
  ```

---

### 21. **What‚Äôs the difference between stop and terminate?**

* **Stop:** Instance can be restarted; EBS data retained.
* **Terminate:** Instance is deleted; data lost unless EBS is kept.

---

### 22. **Can we attach multiple EBS volumes to one EC2?**

* Yes, EC2 can have **multiple EBS volumes** (up to 27 in most cases).

---

### 23. **How do IAM roles work with EC2?**

* Attach role to EC2 to allow access to other AWS services without storing credentials.

---

### 24. **What is ENI (Elastic Network Interface)?**

* A **virtual network interface** that can be attached to EC2 instances.
* Useful for:

  * Dual-homed instances
  * Failover

---

### 25. **How do you troubleshoot EC2 instance connectivity issues?**

* Check:

  * Security group
  * NACLs
  * Route tables
  * Public IP
  * Key pair
  * OS-level firewall (iptables, ufw)

---

## üìò **Bonus Scenario-Based Questions**

### ‚úÖ **Q: Your web server is not accessible over HTTP. How would you troubleshoot?**

* Check:

  * Security group has port 80 open
  * Instance is running
  * Web service is installed and started
  * NACL and route table settings
  * Internet Gateway attached (if public subnet)

---

### ‚úÖ **Q: How do you recover data from a terminated instance?**

* Only possible if:

  * EBS volume is not deleted on termination
  * Then: Attach volume to another EC2

---

### ‚úÖ **Q: How to make EC2 highly available?**

* Use:

  * **Auto Scaling Groups**
  * **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
  * **Instances in multiple AZs**
