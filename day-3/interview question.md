## üî∞ **Basic EC2 Interview Questions**

### 1. **What is Amazon EC2?**

* **Ans:** EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides **resizable compute capacity** in the cloud.
* Key Points: Elastic, scalable, virtual servers, pay-as-you-go model.

1. What are the different EC2 instance families, and how do you choose between them?
Answer:
AWS EC2 instance families are categorized based on the type of workload:

General Purpose (T4g, T3, M6g, M5): Balanced CPU, memory, and network. Good for web servers, small databases.

Compute Optimized (C7g, C6g, C5): High CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for CPU-bound workloads like batch processing or gaming servers.

Memory Optimized (R6g, R5, X2idn): High memory-to-CPU ratio. Best for in-memory databases like Redis or SAP HANA.

Storage Optimized (I4i, D3, H1): Designed for high disk I/O. Useful for big data and NoSQL.

Accelerated Computing (P4, G5, Inf2): Use GPUs or custom chips for ML/AI, inference, rendering.

Follow-up Tip: Always evaluate performance requirements, cost efficiency, and instance architecture (Intel/Graviton) when choosing.

### 3. **What is the difference between an EBS volume and an instance store?**

* **Ans:**

  * **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Persistent storage, survives stop/start.
  * **Instance Store:** Temporary storage, data lost on stop/terminate.

### 4. **What are the types of EBS volumes?**

* **Ans:**

  * gp3, gp2 ‚Äì General purpose SSD
  * io2/io1 ‚Äì Provisioned IOPS SSD

  * Log processing and streaming workloads

---

#### üîπ 5. **sc1 ‚Äì Cold HDD**

  * Disaster recovery
  * Large volumes of rarely used data

---

### üìå **Summary Table:**

| Volume Type | Category | Max IOPS | Use Case                           |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **gp3**     | SSD      | 16,000   | General workloads, better than gp2 |
| **gp2**     | SSD      | 16,000   | Boot volumes, dev/test             |
| **io1/io2** | SSD      | 64,000   | High-performance DBs               |
| **st1**     | HDD      | \~500    | Big data, logs                     |
| **sc1**     | HDD      | \~250    | Archival, backup                   |

---

### üîö Final Tip for Interviews:

Always relate EBS volume choice to **cost, performance, and durability needs**. For example, mention `io2` for high durability in production DBs and `gp3` for everyday scalable workloads.
